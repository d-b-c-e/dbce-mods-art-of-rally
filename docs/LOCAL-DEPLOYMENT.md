# Local deployment

The owner gave standing authorization on 2026-09-09 UTC to keep the installed
copy current. Local deployment is a required checklist item when finishing a
feature or bug fix. After its candidate or final artifact passes the complete
local automated gate, deploy it for testing without asking again. Public release
publication and attended sign-off remain separate.

## Current installation — 0.4.2-rc.4 (KI-47 input recovery)

Installed October 10, 01:21:34 UTC (October 9 local), clean source `20fc617`.
All 20 package gates and the original force corpus pass. ZIP SHA-256:
`2B4E73868E2928462CDB7B4AFB184AF31299318FEA2611C7E0FE7044068D15AD`.
Private receipt and original backup: `results/input-recovery-rc4-install/`.
Every package payload, second native copy and protected settings/probe file
was hash-checked. Game closed, no launch or physical force. Native 901 and
accepted force tune remain unchanged. Attended control/recovery checks are
pending; the original disappearance is not attributed to a proven USB cause.
See [investigation](reviews/2026-10-09-input-recovery.md).

## Previous installation — 0.4.2-rc.3 (steering wording + native lifecycle)

Installed October 8, 09:26 UTC from clean source
`914ea3a983aa52bd78cc0cf8416968db9f0b10b6`. Includes the Steering strength label
and visible effects/tuning link, plus reviewed native 901 / 48-export lifecycle
fixes. Managed toolkit remains v0.15.0; force models and owner tune are unchanged.

- All 20 offline gates and both original force captures pass (215,928 corpus
  assertions, zero model/device mismatch).
- ZIP SHA-256: `16F79235A23039720D5D046CB9C9A541959BF23659B961968FA696DB7319B200`.
- Backup/receipt: `results/native901-20261008/`; exact payloads and second native
  copy verified. 11 protected files unchanged.
- Original owner session 5 cold replay passes all 13,455 driving poses, normal
  exit 0, no gear mismatch/divergence. All 58 raw preferences and three owner
  files restored and independently compared.
- Physical output muted; UI rendering, device recovery and feel remain attended
  checks. Public stable remains 0.4.1; this native component pin is a local RC.

See [native adoption evidence](reviews/2026-10-08-native-lifecycle-adoption.md).

## Previous installation — 0.4.2-rc.2 (KI-46 prompts + frame-rate readout)

Installed 2026-10-07 09:13 UTC (04:13 local) with the game closed, from clean source
`2fbff6d9d543245925777f327d8dc5ba964f7f09` (main; not tagged). Runtime = rc.1 plus the frame-rate readout
(STD-023/024): settings Cameras page shows the last 10 s average/1% low/worst frame, "Show frame rate on screen"
(off by default) draws a counter at the top right of the centre screen, the log gets a line every 30 s.

- All 20 offline gates: `results/rc-0.4.2-rc.2-6a84523d87da458596c77d4050fa0743/automated.json`.
- ZIP SHA-256: `77E8D520522A7203C28E74119E0F6B43E268DD7182B3B025445D9C668906C43F` (fresh extraction of the gated ZIP).
- Backup/receipt: `results/rc-042-rc2-install-20261007-0413/receipt.json`. Payloads match; the seven protected
  files kept their hashes.
- In-game checks pending: KI-46 prompts with the wheel; the frame-rate readout and counter.

## Previous installation — 0.4.2-rc.1 (KI-46 test build)

Installed 2026-10-07 06:55 UTC (01:55 local) with the game closed, from clean source
`2922100d31f645a04383835478a867bc790a1bc8` (main; not tagged). Runtime = 0.4.1 plus KI-46:
menu prompts (e.g. "next weather") show the wheel button's short name ("B12") in the keyboard
badge when the wheel has no artwork, instead of a keyboard badge over a stale gamepad glyph
(`PromptGlyphFallback`, 1f63094).

- All 20 offline gates: `results/rc-0.4.2-rc.1-01052b3ee0094e9996edcbc26774f54b/automated.json`.
- ZIP SHA-256: `61DFCCBBDFDD3861AD4BAA49BC6131331D7F562DCCC3E93DF5EE1EB073AEA8C5` (installed from a fresh
  extraction of `dist/ArtOfSimRally-0.4.2-rc.1.zip`; the gate's own package folder is modified by its upgrade test
  and refuses to install, which is correct).
- Backup/receipt: `results/rc-042-rc1-install-20261007-0154/receipt.json`. All payloads match the package; the
  seven protected files kept their hashes.
- In-game check pending: KI-46 prompts with the wheel (the menu "next weather" prompt and the pause menu).

## Previous installation and stable release — 0.4.1

Installed 2026-10-07 01:08 UTC (October 6 local) with the game closed, and published
the same archive as [v0.4.1](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/dbce-mods-art-of-rally/releases/tag/v0.4.1).
Clean source `7c3de40dce45fe6f5c9e95aadcf88d614876cb8e` (tag `v0.4.1`); runtime source is
identical to 0.4.1-rc.2 (`ddabada`), only documentation changed since.

- Owner tested 0.4.1-rc.2 at the rig on 2026-10-06 (crash rattle, camera keys and
  steps, first-launch logging reset) and approved release ("I approve, let's ship it").
  The owner reported KI-46 (overlapping menu prompts) for later.
- All 20 final gates: `results/rc-0.4.1-3b4ea6074dc14bf5bf410278307680f2/automated.json`.
  The two original owner force captures were revalidated separately against this source
  (215,928 assertions, zero model/device mismatches).
- ZIP SHA-256: `8BD632E89377447B03DCC98EBA9FA44DF6AF7EF6AB3C7A17A4A892605A28BA60`;
  the published ZIP and checksum were downloaded again and match:
  `results/release-041-published-download/verified.json`.
- Backup/receipt: `results/release-041-install-20261006-2008/receipt.json`. All payloads and
  the Plugins native copy match the package; the seven protected files kept their hashes.
- SessionTools was not re-released; the installed 0.4.0 probe folder (`Mods/ArtOfSimRally.DevRecorder`) was left as it was.
## Previous installation — 0.4.1-rc.2

Installed 2026-10-06 04:01:39 UTC with the game closed, from clean source
`ddabadaccb02f43a93a6492b0fb647555133b33e` (pushed to main 2026-10-06; not tagged). Same as
rc.1 plus the crash push + 25 Hz rattle chosen in the owner's CrashFeel run (KI-38).

- All 20 gates: `results/rc-0.4.1-rc.2-6f0e4ac0732d445f873d660c3afe5388/automated.json`.
- ZIP SHA-256: `506CA6C062DC3300639133B5582BBA764838ADD5F2ACCFE452980B491DE62111`.
- Backup/receipt: `results/rc-041-rc2-install-20261005-2301/receipt.json`. Payloads
  and the Plugins native copy match the manifest; protected files unchanged,
  Settings.xml still `8B32882D…`, so the game has not run since rc.1.
- In-game checks pending: KI-45's first-launch logging reset, the crash rattle
  (the saved Crash strength is 19.52381; the standalone pick was made at 50),
  and STD-005/006 camera feel.

Owner authorized merging the pending work on 2026-10-05 and will test tomorrow.
The five existing commits through e979c25 are now on origin/main. Offline force
normalization separately revalidated both original steering captures (11,921
rows, zero model/device mismatches); this does not accept the new crash cue or
camera/logging behavior. Installed package/settings remain as receipted above.

## Previous installation — 0.4.1-rc.1

Installed 2026-10-06 01:39:17 UTC with the game closed, from clean source
`c4b64809c2894cce1885b8254fd46007427b1f5e` (not yet pushed or tagged). Adds the
2026-10-05 T300 feedback fixes (KI-45: support logging off at each launch,
`ffb.log` trimmed over 8 MB, game steering options in support files) to the
unreleased STD-005/006 camera layout and steps. Stable public release is still 0.4.0.

- All 20 gates: `results/rc-0.4.1-rc.1-ead2ae530a3644dfb72a20fd533e2c10/automated.json`.
- ZIP SHA-256: `4996A5213703A46CB74ED347D394B4B67B7F70413110F707AC8C50131ECA2A8E`.
- Backup/receipt: `results/rc-041-rc1-install-20261005-2039/receipt.json`. Eight
  payloads and the Plugins native copy match the manifest; seven protected
  files kept their hashes, including Settings.xml (`8B32882D…`, unchanged since 0.4.0).
  The SessionTools probe folder was left as installed.
- The installed Settings.xml has `DiagnosticLogging` true, so the first launch
  should log "Log detail for support was left on…" and show the toggle off.
  That is KI-45's in-game check. Camera numpad feel (STD-005/006) is still pending.

## Stable release and previous installation — 0.4.0

Installed 2026-10-05 02:07:52 UTC and published 02:13:18 UTC from clean source
`30d421b26eccebc564cd50bf0733c1ed6a82d849`, tag `v0.4.0`. The normal unified
mod and separately opted-in SessionTools probe are installed. The owner accepted
the original session-5 route and requested release. The exact final artifact
then completed that route through finish/results/menu and closed normally.

- All 20 final gates: `results/rc-0.4.0-5e45855793444a9b8ac1c4e24a4d4d09/automated.json`.
- Normal ZIP SHA-256: `C498F8139FD64D13DD395CC036DE71C50614087C216280A17AA3A4724A96B3CA`.
- Optional ZIP SHA-256: `08DA5536F641E7ADAF7B8414DD3C45205A40A90F6F3A43629B14F2B5C8476C94`.
- Backup/receipt: `results/release-040-install-20261004-2107/receipt.json`.
  Eight normal payloads and the second native copy verified; six protected
  settings/game files retained their hashes. Optional seal and launcher matched.
- Final run: `results/sessions/2026-10-04-owner-session-5/replay-20261004-210753`.
  13,455 poses, zero detected position error, exit code 0; environment restored
  02:12:32 UTC. All 58 preferences retain their original types/bytes. Player.log
  reports native 2560x1440 FullScreenWindow, with no exclusive-mode fallback.
- [Published release](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/dbce-mods-art-of-rally/releases/tag/v0.4.0).
  Both archives and both checksum files independently downloaded and matched:
  `results/release-040-published-download/verified.json`.
- Physical output was muted during playback; original-signal analysis remains
  available. Owner visual acceptance is scoped to this route. KI-44's exact
  binding handoff, physical forces and broader hardware/layout cases stay open.

The release comes from `codex/session-playback`. Concurrent remote `main` has a
different component-layout migration; it is not the tested release source and
was not overwritten. Use tag `v0.4.0` or the exact published archives for recovery.

## Previous installation and stable release — 0.2.7

Published and installed **2026-09-30 04:40:57 UTC** with the game closed. This
final-labelled release promotes RC2's runtime behavior. The USB Bind recovery,
off-by-default shift vibration and all other settings are unchanged. The owner
requested stable promotion while physical shift feel, crash at strength 50%
and fresh T300/TSS binding remain unverified. The full attended matrix is open.

- Identity: `0.2.7+255c6f94d1e5ffeea3a6c95d5c7f3828231c3b3d.clean`.
- ZIP SHA-256: `4C0BC7C053F71206DAFD23EFE8F9D621DA673EAECD057C9CDAE01D7E81302577`.
- [Complete final local gate](../results/rc-0.2.7-81f05a57c0ca4f728ac80da0b2831bc4/automated.json):
  all 16 checks passed from clean source, including two recorded-drive cases,
  Unity Mono checks and installer tests. The generated manual checklist remains
  pending; no hardware cases were fabricated as passed.
- [Install receipt and RC2 backup](../results/release-027-install-e4dfcd0e6ae64b9cb3795c4b9e9e57d7/receipt.json):
  six payloads and the second native plugin copy match the tested ZIP. The
  settings file and five other protected files retained their pre-install
  hashes. The game was not launched during installation.
- [GitHub stable release](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/art-of-sim-rally/releases/tag/v0.2.7):
  the release is marked Latest. Independently downloaded ZIP and checksum match
  the tested local files; tag `v0.2.7` points to the clean source commit above.

## Previous installation and prerelease — 0.2.7-rc.2

Installed **2026-09-30 04:00:36 UTC** with the game closed. This candidate adds
an **off-by-default** gear-engagement wheel rumble, initial strength 5% and
range 0–20%, with a shared sine handle and landing/crash priority. The crash
waveform, saved crash strength, steering, telemetry and toolkit remain unchanged.
The owner's saved crash strength is 19.52381%: manually choose 50% for the
next physical comparison. See the [current investigation](research/2026-09-29-crash-shift-feedback.md).

- [Complete local gate](../results/rc-0.2.7-rc.2-f1fa4f2f3f4a4e349b30a6272a010ece/automated.json):
  all 16 checks passed from clean source, including both recorded-drive cases,
  actual Unity Mono hook checks and installer tests.
- [Install receipt and RC1 backup](../results/shift-027-rc2-install-fdc1713154884071822df3e14839e28d/receipt.json):
  six payloads and the second native copy match the tested ZIP. Settings.xml
  and five other protected game/probe files retain their pre-install hashes.
- **Attended status:** not launched or driven after installation. Shift feel,
  real shift timing and crash strength 50% remain to be tested, as do T300/TSS
  and the broader hardware/layout matrix. This is a published test prerelease,
  not a stable-release hardware acceptance.
- [GitHub prerelease](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/art-of-sim-rally/releases/tag/v0.2.7-rc.2):
  both published assets were downloaded and matched the tested local ZIP and
  SHA-256 file. Tag `v0.2.7-rc.2` points to the clean source commit above.

## Previous local installation — 0.2.7-rc.1

Installed **2026-09-30 02:24:47 UTC** with the game closed, following the
0.2.6 T300/TSS binding report. The candidate retains the previous settings and
does not change steering, crash, landing, telemetry or toolkit payloads. It
keeps healthy USB readers open during routine Bind, retries an initially failed
reader, keeps Calibrate on the saved axis, and makes paused/assigned-controls
state visible at the top of Controls. This is an offline-validated candidate,
not a T300/TSS hardware fix confirmation. See [KI-43](KNOWN-ISSUES.md#ki-43--026-binding-and-calibration-may-not-capture-a-separate-tss-handbrake).

  all 16 checks passed from a clean source; both recorded-drive cases passed.
- [Install receipt and 0.2.6 backup](../results/binding-027-rc1-install-9fecf946f0214f819912e9a330c83c48/receipt.json):
  six payloads plus the second native plugin match the tested ZIP. Settings and
  five other protected game/probe files kept their pre-install hashes.
- **Post-install owner test:** cleared and rebound the MOZA handbrake, then
  reported that the drive played well. The current game log recorded the bind;
  Settings.xml contains `MOZA R12 Base` axis 7 with explicit calibration and
  assigned controls enabled. This does not establish T300/TSS behavior, crash
  effect feel, complete UI layout or the full hardware matrix. The
  [attended checklist](../results/rc-0.2.7-rc.1-bd73f449b8f442dab18c0884c1c2f76e/manual.json)
  remains pending. No release publication is implied.

## Previous public release and installation — 0.2.6

Published [0.2.6](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/art-of-sim-rally/releases/tag/v0.2.6)
and installed **2026-09-27 06:02:52 UTC** with the game closed. The owner
accepted the preceding RC16 overall and requested publication. The final-labelled
artifact passed all 16 local gates, including the recorded-drive corpus, actual
Unity Mono checks and installer tests. The final build has not been driven; the

## Previous candidate — 0.2.6-rc.16

Installed **2026-09-23 04:58:32 UTC**, game closed, after all16 local RC gates.
The FFB device selector and its expanded choices are now bounded and show a
selected marker; the saved-disconnected row stays visible but disabled. Refresh
is a compact right-aligned command. The shared shifter picker has the same
choice treatment. FFB device identity, persistence, tune and input are unchanged.

## Previous candidate — 0.2.6-rc.15

Installed **2026-09-23 04:30:35 UTC** (September22 local), game closed, after
all16 local RC gates. RC15 defers the UMM→native bindings route until the actual
initiating control releases for two neutral frames, then clears the general menu
barrier before opening ControlsSettings. Persistent Rewired wheel/pedal axes and
parked joystick buttons cannot latch this explicit handoff. It also replaces
remaining full-width command/disclosure bars with compact actions, segmented
choices and flat links, and makes UMM scale the default for new settings.

  RC10's narrow keyboard pass from its failed layout and RC12's limited layout pass.
- [RC12 smoke and restoration receipt](../results/ux-rc12-smoke-d24e3e71d58f498699f4eba1ea8c28f7/receipt.json):
  readable header/all six page buttons and five Simple page tops fit the default
  4K host; Escape closes only the panel and subsequent native Quit works.
  Normal exit and all16 protected hashes restored at20:51:49.521UTC; no output
  or recording. The remaining camera check followed in a second run.
- [RC12 camera cancellation and restoration receipt](../results/ux-rc12-smoke-74c19cbf1bf5462ead1dad05bbdaff67/receipt.json):
  Cameras and nested scrolling fit; Bind→Escape at8.218s canceled the active edit

  was observed. Normal exit and all16 protected hashes restored at21:05:25.672UTC.
  Comparison of original/after-smoke XML found only the intentional temporary
  FFB/telemetry Off changes; bindings and force strengths were unchanged. Both
  original files are restored byte-for-byte. Full Advanced/scale/input coverage
  remains pending; no output, driving or recording occurred.

Before driving, choose **F6 → FFB → Use steering wheel** or reselect the MOZA;
the saved old name/index lacks an FFB GUID. The installer preserves that choice.

## Previous candidate — 0.2.6-rc.10

Installed **2026-09-19 20:10:28 UTC**, game closed, after all16 local gates.
This replaces RC9's confirmed menu leakage and small4K content with reviewed
dispatch/held-release guards and scoped Auto/UMM text scaling. Live keyboard
isolation/recovery passed, but default4K layout clips controls (KI-40); see

not guess an output device. See [RC9 failure and successor review](reviews/2026-09-19-rc9-ui-smoke.md).

## Previous candidate — 0.2.6-rc.9

Installed **2026-09-19 19:31 UTC** with the game closed after all 16 local gates.

  next drive, use **F6 → FFB → Use steering wheel**, or explicitly reselect
  the MOZA. Steering already has a saved GUID; the new strict selector never
  guesses an output device from an old name/index. No setting was silently changed.
- The no-output UI smoke found native-menu leakage and small4K text (KI-40).
  Normal Quit and exact settings/UMM/payload restoration completed19:52:01UTC.
  See [the evidence and successor retest](reviews/2026-09-19-rc9-ui-smoke.md).

## Previous candidate — 0.2.6-rc.6

Installed **2026-09-17 05:05 UTC** with the game closed after all 16 local
gates. Crashes use method A's finite constant-force push/release, with a
new-settings default of 50 and range 0–100. Landing stays default 5/range 0–40.
The stronger in-game effect still needs an attended test; KI-38 remains open.

## Previous candidate — 0.2.6-rc.4

Installed **2026-09-17 03:57 UTC** (09-16 local) with the game closed after all
16 local gates. Crashes now request a peak-start kick and fading rebound at the
same configured amplitude. Landing requests, steering and telemetry are unchanged.
**Attended follow-up failed:** owner felt no crash effect at about 20 in RC4,
while normal steering worked. Three shape-accepted commands completed without
early managed stops. KI-38 remains open; RC4 is not release-ready.

## Previous installed stable — 0.2.5

**[0.2.5 is published](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/art-of-sim-rally/releases/tag/v0.2.5)
and was installed on 2026-09-13 03:57 UTC.** Wheel landing vibration defaults on
at strength 5; existing saved settings, including the owner's enabled/20, remain.
The accepted built-in SimHub profile and gains are unchanged.

- [Owner acceptance and release limits](reviews/2026-09-13-release-0.2.5.md): overall RC8 acceptance authorizes publication; full attended matrix and a separate final-artifact drive remain unverified.

## Crash recorder update — 2026-09-15 UTC

The separately installed developer probe is now **0.2.5.4/schema 4**, ready to
observe body collisions during the next explicitly started recording. Stable
0.2.5 and the installed settings remain unchanged. No recorder is shipped in the
release package; nothing is recording and the game is closed.

- Probe SHA-256: `4FBACE0242834376CEA8903AAA0A08C86D3A6EBA83E63AF0659BD92518916EE7`.

- [All 16 local gates](../results/rc-0.2.5-rc.11-104bedc73e144db98e651c4c22d27263/automated.json),
  including both real drive cases and actual-Mono collision hook attachment.
- The local rc.11 ZIP is packaging validation only, not a changed game build to
  deploy. No public release or SimHub profile change.
- [Crash baseline, fixes and live-test limits](reviews/2026-09-15-crash-capture.md).

## Documentation/installer audit — no game deployment

The 2026-09-13 audit validates revised installer/readme packaging as local
`0.2.5-rc.10`; all 16 gates pass. It changes no game/force code. Installed stable
0.2.5 above remains the current game payload, and published assets are unchanged.
The new installer/template are for the next package; no game redeployment was
needed. [Audit and exact validation evidence](reviews/2026-09-13-docs-install-audit.md).

## Previous candidate — RC8 restored after RC9 withdrawal

**RC8 restored on 2026-09-13 01:36 UTC.** The owner rejected RC9's extra SimHub
helper; its game code/plugin/profile were removed. The exact RC8 archive below
was reinstalled, with settings/probe preserved and the Stream Deck target unchanged.
[New receipt and RC9 backup](../results/landing-rc8-install-c9b92ca721ed45d892901e8381a45b75/receipt.json).
SimHub now has a built-in-effects-only 30 Hz comparison profile; the original
profile/gains are preserved. [Correction, evidence and retest](reviews/2026-09-12-builtin-shaker-correction.md).

**0.2.5-rc.8** was first installed on 2026-09-12 23:54 UTC. It adds opt-in landing
vibration with independent strength to RC7. The existing settings were preserved;
landing vibration defaults to off, with strength 5 when enabled.

- Identity: `0.2.5-rc.8+b9598f5cb6b0a48965b37f4f8d27f350fd59be49.clean`.
- ZIP SHA-256: `90F3F0BD942FD6F446702BAF185842196090B54882D821AE737AE1046CDAFADB`.
- [All 16 gates passed, including the real drive corpus and landing detection](../results/rc-0.2.5-rc.8-669ae7f5aae140ca9e793fd9ad0b1781/automated.json).
- [Installation receipt and RC7 backup](../results/landing-rc8-install-a1e5dbdfefd9432d98ebeea43f31b65d/receipt.json).
- Six mod payloads and the native plugin copy match the exact validated package.
  Settings and separate probe 0.2.5.3 were preserved byte-for-byte. The game stayed
  closed; the Steam/Stream Deck installation target is unchanged.
- Toolkit pin is `local+dd0ef20ad0cdaccc7a67f10a707dbd2a27a6efe9.clean`, managed
  0.13.0/native 0.6.0. This is an unpublished development candidate. Final
  packaging rejects local toolkit pins; official publication/repin is required.
- [Landing A/B test](LANDING-EFFECTS.md), FFB startup/recovery, digital gauge
  clearing, quit and font scaling remain attended checks. The first nonzero
  [owner landing test](reviews/2026-09-12-landing-wheel-test.md) logs eight accepted
  wheel cues. Owner says wheel FFB is fine; the desired stronger ButtKicker thud
  is a separate telemetry/haptic-output follow-up.
  No public release; stable remains 0.2.4.

## Previous candidate — RC7

**0.2.5-rc.7** was installed on 2026-09-12 16:44 UTC. It adds the KI-32 font
scaling correction and clearer handbrake/logging/smoothing help to RC6.

- Identity: `0.2.5-rc.7+8dfa61c5fb2212273059ec3714421c9e4fc7debe.clean`.
- ZIP SHA-256: `948D410F34102C7739ECD5148E81EA8EEDE3A29250BEF7C16BFDAE5F9343E0F2`.
- [All 16 gates passed, including the real drive corpus](../results/rc-0.2.5-rc.7-cf98987b0c984f4eb37175090bafa10f/automated.json).
- [Installation receipt and RC6 backup](../results/support-questions-rc7-install-38dee4a087ec466c92ca750c9b2b800b/receipt.json).
- Six mod payloads and the native plugin copy match the exact validated package.
  Settings and the separate 0.2.5.3 probe were preserved byte-for-byte. The game
  stayed closed; the Steam/Stream Deck installation target is unchanged.
- Font scaling still needs an in-game visual check; all prior hardware gates
  remain pending. No public release or support reply was sent. Stable is 0.2.4.

## Previous candidate — RC6

**0.2.5-rc.6** was installed on 2026-09-11 03:34 UTC, from the exact package
that passed all 16 local gates **including one real recorded drive**.

- Identity: `0.2.5-rc.6+8ea54775efa42fe60b367760c72bb0f9668a1c9a.clean`.
- ZIP SHA-256: `A0A99CFA2678142D09C1F63F391D5127706B171C98FC7FF9F84B2B39FD39A4E4`.
- [Gate](../results/rc-0.2.5-rc.6-3166e9988c98438dbf669170f92253c7/automated.json),
  [installation receipt and RC5 backup](../results/bug-investigation-20260911/install-rc6/receipt.json).
- All six installed payloads and the second native plugin copy match the package;
  settings were preserved byte-for-byte. The Steam/Stream Deck game directory
  remains the same. Game stayed closed; no public release or attended pass.
- Optional developer probe **0.2.5.3** is installed, hash
  `F911A673F992963C99E5A10D048C9F849D82A8582BBC87EF9B9D64E815778D49`.
  It remains separate from the release ZIP; previous probe backed up.
- Local DSS speed/RPM dashboard bindings were backed up and repaired. SimHub
  exited normally and restarted on 03:35 UTC; logs confirm both round displays
  reloaded their dashboard. Physical end-of-race clearing remains untested.
- [Fixes, signal study and remaining tests](reviews/2026-09-11-bug-follow-up.md).

## Previous candidate — RC5

**0.2.5-rc.5** was installed after passing all 16 local checks, with settings and
the Steam 550320 launch target preserved. [Current candidate evidence and receipt](reviews/2026-09-09-overnight-025.md).
The earlier 0.2.4 installation below is backed up. No candidate hardware result
or public publication was implied by deployment. The subsequent owner drive
reported FFB startup and telemetry gauge failures (KI-28/KI-29); RC5's attended
gate now fails those cases. Do not publish this candidate.

- UMM displays **0.2.5**; support/build.json identify
  `0.2.5-rc.5+43e0b4a2978121e712d20c8f170567b587554bdf.clean`.
- [RC5 install receipt and RC3 backup](../results/overnight-025-install-156deb45275a414bba20b5ee1f2135a5/install-receipt.json).
- Six mod payloads and the native plugin copy match the exact package; settings
  were unchanged at deployment. Game stayed closed, developer probe was absent,
  Stream Deck preserved.
- RC4 passed offline but was superseded before installation by the shifter
  selection-display correction in RC5. Published stable remains 0.2.4.

For the owner's attended drive on 2026-09-10 local time, the separate developer
probe **0.2.5.2** is installed after correcting KI-26 and adding the KI-27 menu-quit
save hook. Explicit menu-only saving and CSV hashes passed in Unity; the automatic
quit-save path still needs a drive. RC5/settings were preserved during replacement. The probe
was present; remove the current probe with the game closed before the comparison drive
without instrumentation. [Capture setup and receipts](reviews/2026-09-10-attended-rc5.md).

## Previous stable installation

- **0.2.4 stable**, installed 2026-09-09 03:09:23 UTC with the game closed, from
  the downloaded [GitHub release](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/art-of-sim-rally/releases/tag/v0.2.4).
- Identity: `0.2.4+dc14fe70002205e59c8b462c8c8636b72132abdd.clean`.
- UMM displays **0.2.4**; build.json/support now show the final identity without an RC suffix.
- ZIP SHA-256: `08AA70055C4957DA8C96EAB2078BA0F52211E51B7249C38A0B409BBC6AD50942`.
- [Install receipt and RC5 backup location](../results/release-0.2.4-install-3b9ec98a27bf415b807d7974ff3484c3/install-receipt.json).
- All six mod payloads plus the second native plugin copy match the published
  package manifest; Settings.xml preserved byte-for-byte. RC5 install/settings
  backed up before replacement. Published asset digests independently verified.
- Existing Steam 550320 Stream Deck button launches this installation; developer
  recorder remains absent. No game was launched as part of deployment.
- [Final release evidence](reviews/2026-09-09-release-0.2.4.md): all 16 local
  automated checks pass. Owner accepted RC5, which has the same production source
  and toolkit; detailed attended cases and final-labelled drive remain pending.

## Deployment rules

1. Use the newest eligible local artifact on this project's current development
   line. Validate its clean source identity, all required automated checks and
   archive hash against `results/rc-*/automated.json`, using
   `tools/testing/rc_gate.py`'s `verify_automated` where useful. Exclude candidates
   with failed attended cases, withdrawn/superseded builds and version downgrades.
   An unchanged installed identity needs no deployment or rebuild.
2. If `artofrally.exe` is running, defer. Never close the game to perform a routine
   update. Extract the exact validated ZIP, validate its manifest, and back up
   the existing mod, Settings.xml and `Plugins/x86_64/UnityForceFeedback.dll`.
3. Run the extracted package's `install.ps1 -GameDir` against the existing install,
   then match all six mod files, native plugin copy and build identity to the
   manifest/report. Verify the settings hash is unchanged; retain the backup and
   report failures instead of claiming success.
4. Save a local receipt under `results`, update this installed-candidate record
   and session handoff, and report the actual deployed version. Preserve wheel
   tuning, controls, Stream Deck action and optional developer-probe state. Do not
   launch a game or mark attended checks passed as part of deployment.

## Feature completion checklist

- [ ] Build and validate the completed feature/fix in an immutable local artifact.
- [ ] Deploy that exact artifact with the game closed, backing up the previous
  install and preserving settings.
- [ ] Verify all payloads, native plugin copy, identity and unchanged settings;
  save the receipt and report the installed version in the handoff.

If the game is running, leave deployment pending and pick it up at the next active
work session. Do not close the game or set up periodic checks. The owner stopped
scheduled polling on 2026-09-09 UTC; automation
`keep-art-of-sim-rally-installed-build-current` is paused. An unchanged build or
documentation-only work needs no rebuild or redeployment.
