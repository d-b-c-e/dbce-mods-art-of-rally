# Releasing

Player instructions are in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md). Local build prerequisites are
in [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md). This document is for maintainers.

## One mod, not four

All four features ship as a single mod with per-feature toggles, and that is
deliberate rather than lazy packaging:

- They hang off the same two Harmony hooks. `CarDynamics.FixedUpdate` serves both
  force feedback and telemetry; `CarController.Start` serves both the steering fix
  and the calibration fix. Split into separate mods, each would install its own
  patch on the same methods, and users would be running two or three copies of the
  same hook.
- The steering and deadzone fixes are prerequisites for the rest feeling right.
  Someone who installs "the force feedback mod" alone and still has a 27 degree
  dead band would reasonably conclude the force feedback is bad.
- Anything unwanted is one config line away from off.

The config is grouped by feature so this reads clearly to a user:

```
[Steering]  DirectSteering, ZeroAxisDeadzone, BindAnyDevice, GlyphTextFallback, DisableSteerAssist
[ForceFeedback]  Enabled, Strength, FyReference, Smoothing, Invert, PreferredDevice(+Index/Guid), DiagnosticLogging
[Shifter]  Enabled, IsHPattern, DeviceIndex/Name/Guid, SkipNeutral, gear and shift buttons
[WheelInput]  Enabled, Steer/Throttle/Brake/Clutch/Handbrake bindings ("device|index|axis:N|rest|far|guid:<instance-guid>"; legacy five fields accepted)
[Camera]  Bonnet* and Bumper*: Enabled, Height, Forward, Side, Pitch, FOV; BonnetLean
[CameraTuning]  remappable keyboard hotkeys (numpad defaults)
[Telemetry]  Enabled, Host, Port
[Experiment]  UseDirectInputBackend (Settings.xml only; see CONTROLS.md)
```

## Loader: Unity Mod Manager (done)

Shipping for **Unity Mod Manager**, which has official art of rally support in its
own game database:

```xml
<GameInfo Name="Art of Rally">
  <EntryPoint>[UnityEngine.UIModule.dll]UnityEngine.Canvas.cctor:Before</EntryPoint>
  <StartingPoint>[Assembly-CSharp.dll]GameEntryPoint.Start:After</StartingPoint>
</GameInfo>
```

Reasons, in order of weight:

1. **It is what the community already runs.** The Nexus camera mod requires it, so
   most people who would install this already have it.
2. **In-game settings.** UMM draws a settings panel at Ctrl+F10. That matters more
   than usual here: force feedback strength and the camera mount can only be judged
   while driving, and the alternative is quitting to edit a text file for every
   adjustment.

3. **It would have collided with BepInEx.** Verified after installing: UMM's
   installer wrote Doorstop to the game root, exactly as BepInEx does.

   ```ini
   ; <game>/doorstop_config.ini, alongside <game>/winhttp.dll
   target_assembly = artofrally_Data\Managed\UnityModManager\UnityModManager.dll
   ```

   Worth recording how this got muddled, because the trap is easy to fall into
   twice. UMM's game database defines an `EntryPoint` for art of rally that looks
   like assembly injection, and reading that alone led to retracting a correct
   claim. UMM supports both mechanisms and its installer chose Doorstop here.
   **A config file describes a capability; only the install shows which one was
   actually used.**

Development originally used BepInEx because it installs unattended; UMM's installer
is a GUI. That is a fine reason to prototype with it and a poor reason to ship it.

### How the port stayed contained

`Main.cs` is the only loader-aware file. Everything else talks to `ModLog` and a
plain-field `Settings` class, so supporting a second loader means adding a sibling
of `Main.cs` rather than touching a single patch. The pieces a loader entry point
provides:

1. `Info.json` — `Id`, `DisplayName`, `Version`, `AssemblyName`, `EntryMethod`.
2. `Main.Load(UnityModManager.ModEntry)` — creates the Harmony instance, patches,
   installs the watchdog.
3. `Settings : UnityModManager.ModSettings` with plain serialized fields;
   `SettingsPanel` draws the custom Ctrl+F10 interface.
4. References to `UnityModManager.dll` and its Harmony, extracted into `lib/umm`
   and **never committed**.

Two build notes worth keeping:

- The project targets **net48**, not net472, because UMM's own assemblies are
  built against .NET Framework 4.8 and will not resolve from a lower target.
  Unity 2019.4's Mono runs both.
- The custom panel owns labels/help and section layout; UMM owns the surrounding UI.

Shipping both loaders remains possible — two thin entry assemblies over the shared
core — but keep one as the documented default so support questions stay simple.

## Package contents and native placement

The zip contains `ArtOfSimRally/` at its root for UMM, plus Install.bat,
Uninstall.bat, install.ps1, verify.ps1, README.txt, LICENSE and manifest.json.
The standalone README.txt is generated from `tools/installer/README.txt`, with
`@RELEASE@` replaced at packaging time. Keep it aligned with README.md and SETUP.md;
use web links for details that are not included in the ZIP. Published archives
are immutable; updated installer/docs payloads go into the next package.
The mod folder contains only Info.json, build.json, ArtOfSimRally.Mod.dll,
Dbce.Wheel.Ffb.dll, Dbce.Wheel.Telemetry.dll and UnityForceFeedback.dll. No game
or UMM assemblies or user Settings.xml are packaged. The development recorder
is a separate optional installation; packaging rejects its types/dependencies
in the production assembly as well as unexpected payload files.

The native artifact is our toolkit's x64 WheelFfb.dll, shipped under the name
UnityForceFeedback.dll. The batch installer deliberately copies it **both** beside
the mod and into `artofrally_Data/Plugins/x86_64`. UMM's archive route installs the
mod-folder copy. Neither path proves staleness: compare observed module hashes
with the tested package. If multiple copies differ, close the game and reinstall
the complete candidate; do not delete a correct plugin copy merely for its path.

## Cutting a release

The owner has standing authorization to keep the local test installation current.
As a checklist item when finishing a feature or bug fix, deploy its artifact after
the automated gate passes, with the game closed and settings/backups preserved;
no new permission request is needed. If the game is open, record a pending deploy
for the next active work session. Do not schedule periodic deployment checks. See
[LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md](LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md). Public publication and attended
sign-off still follow the steps below.

Build, test and package releases **locally**, then upload the exact validated
archive and its SHA-256 file directly with the GitHub CLI. This is the owner's
release-build preference from 2026-09-08; do not add or dispatch GitHub Actions
builds unless the owner changes it. The repository had no Actions workflows when
checked on that date. GitHub hosts the source and release assets; it does not
need to rebuild the archive.

1. Vendor the intended official toolkit release using the transactional
   Sync-Toolkit.ps1. For 0.2.6, the five v0.15.0 payloads match the tested
   local RC16 pin byte-for-byte.
   Confirm VERSION and hashes; do not label an unreleased toolkit build as a
   published toolkit version. Building this consumer locally is the normal path.
2. Keep `Version.props` and source Info.json on the same numeric UMM version.
   Run `tools/testing/Test-Rc.ps1 -Version X.Y.Z-rc.N` with an unused RC number.
   It builds with warnings as errors, runs consumer checks, validates vendor
   hashes/exports and packages the identified artifact. Existing RCs are immutable.
3. Close the game, install that zip and complete the generated attended checklist.
   See [PRE-RELEASE-TESTING.md](PRE-RELEASE-TESTING.md) for captures and evidence.
4. Run `python tools/testing/rc_gate.py check <manual.json>`. Pending cases,
   missing evidence and changed archives return nonzero. A build alone is not a gate.
5. Review the concise Unreleased notes; keep unconfirmed hardware reports open.
   Commit the source, prepare the final-labelled artifact from a clean tree, and
   validate that exact artifact before tagging or publishing. Rebuilding changes
   its identity and invalidates the earlier artifact's sign-off.
6. When publication is authorized, create and push a tag at the **source commit
   recorded in the artifact's identity**, even if later documentation commits
   exist. Use `gh release create` with that tag, the exact ZIP and `.zip.sha256`,
   `--verify-tag` and `--notes-file` pointing to the reviewed release notes.
   For a candidate, include `--prerelease --latest=false` to preserve the stable
   release. No workflow dispatch or remote rebuild is involved.
7. Download the published ZIP and checksum with `gh release download` into a
   separate local folder and compare their SHA-256 against the automated report.
   Keep the report and attended checklist tied to the same archive. Never
   overwrite a published candidate to insert fixes; use a new version instead.

The existing 0.2.4-rc.4 ZIP was already built and tested locally; its
[exact identity and reports](reviews/2026-09-08-feedback-review.md) remain valid.
Changing the upload procedure does not require rebuilding it or imply that its
pending attended checks have passed.

`tools/package/package.ps1 -Version X.Y.Z` remains the packaging entry point for
a final clean-tree build; it does not itself authorize publication or claim game
tests passed. Numeric UMM/assembly versions and the full informational build
identity are validated before archiving. Archive and payload hashes are retained.

Use `tools/testing/Test-Rc.ps1 -Version X.Y.Z -Final` to run the complete offline
suite against a final-labelled artifact, including packaging and installation
tests. This creates a new attended checklist; `-Final` does not mark it passed.

`dotnet test ArtOfSimRally.sln` runs no tests; the explicit executable runners in
the RC script are the automated evidence. Native/telemetry source suites live in
the toolkit. The optional SessionTools adapter now recreates recorded trajectories
in Unity; its live evidence is separate from this offline gate and physical acceptance.
Package it with `tools/package/session-tools.ps1 -Version X.Y.Z` from the same
clean source. Publish its ZIP/checksum as a separate optional asset; never add
probe dependencies to the player mod. Preserve original captures privately.

## Channels

| Where | Notes |
|---|---|
| **GitHub releases** | Current distribution and source of truth; exact validated ZIP/checksum. |
| **Nexus Mods** | Planned distribution; UMM packaging. No current listing is claimed here. |
| **OverTake.gg** | Possible future distribution for the sim racing audience. |
| **Official Discord** | Possible announcement/support channel; posting is a separate authorized action. |
| **In-game CurseForge browser** | `ModManager` with `GameID 78103`. Content pipeline — cars, liveries, stages. Almost certainly will not accept a code mod; unverified. |

## Honesty in the release notes

Two things to state plainly, because both will otherwise generate complaints:

1. **Tested on one wheel.** Everything was developed against a MOZA R12 Base. The
   deadzone and steering findings should apply to any wheel Rewired does not
   recognise, which is likely every modern direct-drive base, but that is
   reasoning rather than testing. `FyReference` will need tuning per wheel.
2. **Leaderboards.** `DirectSteering` and `ZeroAxisDeadzone` restore what a
   recognised wheel already gets and are fair-play neutral. `DisableSteerAssist`
   genuinely changes driving aids and is off by default. Say so, so nobody enables
   it by accident and posts a time.
