# User feedback and support follow-up

## T300/TSS follow-up — received 2026-10-05 (0.2.6 support file, 0.2.7-rc.2 shift cue)

Same T300 RS + TSS handbrake reporter (Reddit). Support file generated
2026-09-30 on 0.2.6, Germany Holzerath, Group A Subaru, ended in a crash.

- **Rotation:** settled on 620° in the Thrustmaster panel (700 felt too slow,
  540 too sensitive). Preference only; no defect.
- **Crashes not felt** (Crash strength 50, steering Strength 40). 56 accepted
  cues; the last was a full 0.5 pulse with steering output at 0. New KI-38
  evidence; see there.
- **Understeer / "steering assist 20":** the trace's corner shows steering
  held at 0.80 while front slip ran to 41–44° against an ideal of about 9°, with
  the wheel going light. That is overdriven fronts, not an input cap. The
  game's on/off steer-assist limiter does not apply to a recognised T300.
  Which option "20" means is unknown; 0.4.1-rc.1 support files will show it
  (KI-17, FINDINGS 2026-10-05).
- **Logging "on by default":** it was saved on from an earlier support
  request; the default has always been off. Fixed in 0.4.1-rc.1 (KI-45).
- **0.2.7-rc.2 shift cue:** "work very well... adds immersion". The user tried
  it at maximum ("100%"; the slider tops out at 20%) and prefers the default
  5%. First positive feel report for the cue, on a T300.
- Other support-file facts: FFB, landing (3 accepted at 40) and alt-tab
  re-acquire all normal. Frame health clean (KI-19 data point). Autocentre
  `0x800700AA` is harmless (FINDINGS). The game's own bindings show Clutch and
  Handbrake on "Accelerator -" on the T300. That is probably inert (the
  handbrake runs through Wheel input on the TSS), but unconfirmed.

**Unsent reply draft:**

> Thanks for the log and the details. 620° sounds like a good spot!
>
> **Steering:** everything in your log looks normal. FFB was running, alt-tab
> recovery worked and frame times were smooth. In the corner your log caught,
> you had about 80% lock in, and the front tyres were sliding at roughly 40° when

Before sending: confirm the "stronger, longer kick" wording matches what the
owner decides for KI-38, and point to whichever build carries the logging fix.

**2026-09-29 T300/TSS report on 0.2.6:** the new UI is much easier to use.
Existing wheel/pedal/TSS bindings carried over; the inverted TSS handbrake
showed an analog 0–100% preview. After experimenting with Bind, the handbrake
stopped working and no new Bind/Calibrate input appeared for any axis. Returning
to 0.2.5 to rebind the handbrake, then reinstalling 0.2.6, restored it.
Track as [KI-43](KNOWN-ISSUES.md#ki-43--026-binding-and-calibration-may-not-capture-a-separate-tss-handbrake);
the exact action and failed-state support file are missing. Landing at 40 now
feels pronounced to this user. Crash at 100 was enabled but not assessed.
Requested an optional subtle shift cue, recorded in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
Occasional tight-corner understeer at steering assist 20, wheel rotation 700
degrees and steering status are questions, not proven mod defects. Avoid
claiming a game-designed rotation angle or that a support file proves physical
steering lock. A useful follow-up asks for pause/assigned-controls state and
the support file before another reinstall.

**2026-09-27 release follow-up:** 0.2.6 is public. The GitHub issue audit found
no new report or comment after 2026-09-06. Issue #1 remains open with the
reporter's PS5-controller workaround; it still needs a paired controller
comparison before closure. No public reply was sent in this release pass.

**Historical feedback through 2026-09-16:** 0.2.5 was published, including default-on wheel
landing vibration and clearer/scaling-aware settings help. The owner accepted
the built-in SimHub comparison and observed clipping. Current setup answers
are in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) and [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
Dated reports and unsent drafts below preserve their original context; replace
old version references before sending them. No new public reply was sent.
Owner tested 0.2.6-rc.3 with crashes on/19.52381 and reported no distinct crash
effect. Its 13 accepted commands motivate the new shaped kick (KI-38); see
[review](reviews/2026-09-17-crash-kick.md) and [current installation](LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md).
The reporter's feedback and public download remain 0.2.5.
Owner's next RC4 test likewise felt no crash output at about 20; normal steering
worked. The support file confirms three full-intensity shaped commands and zero
early managed stops. See [analysis](reviews/2026-09-17-rc4-crash-feel.md); do not
describe the changed waveform as a successful physical fix.

Owner subsequently completed standalone A/B/C tests. Only constant pulse A
was faintly felt at 20%; at 40% A was preferred but still too weak. Owner requests
crash default50/range0–100 and sharing the findings upstream. The next candidate
uses a finite constant pulse; the updated Desktop tester already offers those
levels. No 50–100% physical acceptance is recorded. See the
[constant-pulse follow-through](reviews/2026-09-17-constant-crash.md).

## 0.2.5 T300/TSS follow-up — received 2026-09-16

Reporter says steering feels better than ever, different cars feel distinct,
and the handbrake now works perfectly. Remaining questions/reports:

- Finland Haapajarvi landing vibration at 20 feels just before visible touchdown
  (KI-36). Requests a 30–40 option and crash vibration.
- Slight stutter in the first five seconds on that track, uncertain whether the
  unmodified game also does it (KI-5). Desktop log created but not received.
- Asks analog versus digital handbrake and how to send the file; offers a donation.

Keep these scoped to the reported build/track. Successful handbrake operation
does not yet establish axis selection or intermediate travel. The saved Norway
jump shows contact one physics step before recorded compression, a useful lead
for KI-36, not a diagnosis of this report. Owner subsequently authorized crash
implementation; the optional 0.2.6 candidate is documented in
[CRASH-EFFECTS](CRASH-EFFECTS.md). SimHub motion changes require input/output evidence.

Investigation update: the game separates raycast contact, wheel rendering and its
own all-wheel landing cue. One saved jump shows a 16.67 ms gap, but the reported
track remains unobserved. A local toolkit fix removes default per-force disk writes;
support now measures smaller frame spikes and contact/compression timing. No landing
delay or gain change, no proven startup-stutter resolution, no public update yet.

Subsequent owner-authorized strength update: both wheel-impact sliders now extend
to 40% in installed local candidate rc.3, with existing values and default 5 unchanged.
This implements the requested 30–40 option without changing landing timing or
SimHub signals. Stronger-range wheel feel remains untested; public 0.2.5 is unchanged.

**Unsent reply draft:**

Really glad 0.2.5 feels good, and great to hear the handbrake is working!

1. The landing effect currently starts at the first wheel contact. That may
   explain the slightly early feel; I'm checking contact versus visual timing. A short
   clip would help compare it with visible touchdown. I've also built a separate
   crash-vibration candidate for testing; it isn't in the public download yet.
   The test candidate also allows landing and crash strengths up to 40;
   your current 20 keeps its output, and higher values add headroom for your wheel.
2. Please open https://github.com/d-b-c-e/art-of-sim-rally/issues/new and drag your
   Desktop support .txt into the description. Include the car and whether the
   early stutter repeats after restarting Haapajarvi. That gives me something
   concrete to check before attributing it to the mod. Attachments there are public.
   I've also removed some unnecessary force-logging disk writes in a test build,
   though I haven't confirmed whether those caused your hitch.
3. If you've assigned the TSS **axis** in Wheel input (direct), it is analog:
   partial pulls pass values between 0 and 1 into the game's existing handbrake
   calculation. A button binding is on/off. Check the live Handbrake value at
   half pull to confirm which you're using.

And thank you for the kind offer!

## Stronger crashes — owner request, 2026-09-14

Follow-through 2026-09-15 UTC: owner drove several head-on impacts and at least
one light side impact. Saved/verified 2,947 motion/force samples while paused;
replay passes exactly. The largest head-on deceleration has almost no steering
output, supporting an independent crash cue. Body-event capture is added in
probe 0.2.5.4 for the next drive. SimHub receiver/output data was not captured.
[Evidence and limits](reviews/2026-09-15-crash-capture.md).

Owner requests more noticeable crashes in wheel FFB and motion telemetry, and
confirmed **SimHub** drives the motion platform. Track under FR-2. Source review
found a game collision-rumble path that wheel FFB does not consume; production
telemetry preserves synthetic crash impulses in the new 48-scenario checks.
Actual SimHub input/output timing and a labelled crash capture are still needed.
No gain/profile changes or crash effect were installed. The accepted landing
settings remain the baseline. [Investigation and next steps](research/2026-09-14-crash-feedback.md).

## Landing feature implementation — 2026-09-12

**Accepted for release:** owner reports landings felt better with the built-in
30 Hz profile and saw the amplifier CLIP light. They called it good enough,
authorized release and asked for landing vibration on by default. Implemented
the existing wheel feature's default at strength 5, preserving saved preferences.
The rig's installed strength 20 remains its saved setting. No SimHub helper or
further shaker gain increase. Latest preserved RC8 log has four accepted wheel
bursts. Full hardware matrix cases remain individually unverified.

First RC8 owner drive: initially reported a subtle landing effect, then clarified
that **wheel FFB is fine; the ButtKicker should deliver a hard, noticeable thud**.
The maximum wheel slider and eight accepted wheel requests do not measure shaker
output. They report maximizing ButtKicker settings; amplifier clipping has not
been checked. Owner subsequently rejected RC9's extra SimHub helper; it has been
removed and RC8 restored. Prioritize built-in Impacts/Road impacts tuning under
FR-2, keeping physical telemetry accurate. A 30 Hz comparison profile is ready.
Logs were preserved while paused; no
new recording was running. Full lifecycle checks remain pending.
[Corrected attended evidence](reviews/2026-09-12-landing-wheel-test.md).

Owner requested implementation/testing before the next release. FR-2 now has
an opt-in landing-vibration candidate with an independent strength control.
Road/crash effects remain planned. The user's saved one-jump drive verifies the
detector; physical feel and reporter hardware support are not yet confirmed.
See [landing evidence and test steps](LANDING-EFFECTS.md). Do not tell reporters
this is in the stable download until it is published.

## T300/TSS setup questions — received 2026-09-12

The user enjoys the new version and acknowledges the stutter work; exact build
and an explicit stutter retest result were not supplied. The separate USB TSS
appears as "no profile" in the game's device view and can bind shifter button 2,
but the user still tries to bind the handbrake through stock controls (KI-13).
They ask for the support-log workflow, larger explanatory text and an explanation
of Smoothing 0.20. Font scaling is a confirmed consumer UI defect (KI-32).

Code review confirms only assigned direct-input channels override the car's
inputs; both diagnostic checkboxes edit the same setting. The pinned toolkit's
filter retains the smoothing fraction of the prior force. Shifter button
assignment does not prove or disprove analog-axis availability on this TSS.
No new hardware result or message sent is implied.

**Unsent reply draft (font correction is not in published 0.2.4):**

Thanks for the feedback! Here's how those work:

1. **TSS handbrake:** pause, open Ctrl+F10 → **Wheel input (direct)** and enable
   **Read the wheel directly**. With the lever released, click **Assign** beside
   **Handbrake**, then pull it through its full travel, keeping other controls
   still. Leave steering/pedal rows unassigned if those already work. This reads
   the separate USB device directly, so you don't need to assign it in the game's
   controls. "No profile" doesn't prevent this. Check that Handbrake moves
   gradually from 0 released to 1 pulled; use **Flip** if reversed. If the lever
   also shifts gears, clear its shift bindings or disable **Use a separate
   shifter**. If it won't assign or only shows 0/1, send a support file and the
   readings at rest, half pull and full pull so we can check its axis reporting.
2. **Logs:** yes, that's the order. Enable **Log detail for support** in either
   section (they're the same switch), reproduce briefly, pause, then choose
   **Devices and troubleshooting → Create support file on Desktop** before
   restarting. Send that generated text file, then turn detailed logging off.
   Normal errors are still collected when detailed logging is off.
3. **Small text:** you found a bug: the explanations had a fixed font size.
   I've corrected it in the next candidate so it follows Mod Manager's scale;
   the fix isn't in the public download yet.
4. **Smoothing:** it softens rapid changes in wheel force. At 0.20, each update
   blends 20% of the previous force with 80% of the new one. Higher values reduce
   rattle/notchiness but soften bumps and make feedback less immediate. Zero is
   unfiltered. It affects FFB, not steering input; use Strength to lighten the
   wheel overall.

## GitHub audit — 2026-09-11 UTC

One open issue, [#1](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/art-of-sim-rally/issues/1), with
the reporter's existing PS5-unplug workaround comment. No new issue reports or
PRs, and no maintainer acknowledgment. Read-only audit; nothing posted or closed.

**Unsent draft:** Thanks for the follow-up—good to hear unplugging the PS5 pad
resolved it. I'm keeping this open while we narrow down the controller/camera
interaction. If it happens again on 0.2.4, please attach a fresh support file and
mention whether the PS5 pad and Nexus camera mod were active.

Recorded 2026-09-08 UTC after publishing 0.2.3. Reports describe their own builds
and setups; they are not all tests of 0.2.3. Implementation work is ordered in
[OVERNIGHT-QUEUE.md](OVERNIGHT-QUEUE.md); defects remain in
[KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md).

Overnight follow-through: camera key remapping and save recovery are implemented
for the 0.2.4 candidate; the input suite adds 90 assertions and fixes cache, Flip
and assignment recovery defects (KI-15). T300 rotation and effect-signal research
are complete to the offline scope in
[the signal audit](research/2026-09-08-wheel-signals.md). No new hardware result
or support reply was obtained/sent. Original feedback below retains its context.

## Owner RC6 drive

Exact feedback: "no stutter, camera worked great, and no issues with the controls
so far." Rig: owner's MOZA R12 setup. The installed RC6's local UMM log confirms
toolkit initialization and live driving force evaluation. The log records Strength
50; the earlier Strength 26 observation remains historical. Smoothing is 0.2 in
the preserved installed settings.

This passes a scoped driving smoke check. It does not enumerate every camera
transition, focus recovery, restart persistence or live telemetry consumer case.
The final-labelled ZIP has the same production source/toolkit, but has not yet
been driven. Full checklist and real capture corpus remain pending.

## T300 RS GT / TSS feedback supplied by the owner

Source: pasted user message in this task; mod version and driver/firmware versions
not supplied. Wheel and pedals: Thrustmaster T300 RS GT. Separate TSS is in
handbrake mode; wheel paddles provide shifts. The user drives in the stock high
chase view with another camera mod bringing it closer. Preserve that camera-mod
combination when investigating; they are not using our mounted views.

The user reports markedly better steering than stock, several enjoyable hours of
tinkering, and a strong preference for this wheel experience. Their earlier
x360ce setup supplied controller-like rumble and handbrake mapping; our constant
steering force has different behavior and does not reproduce that rumble track.

| Feedback | Current evidence / next action |
|---|---|
| Set rotation to 700 degrees; Thrustmaster panel shows 1080 after launch, though steering still feels near 700 | KI-12. Cause and actual physical lock unknown. No degrees-setting API found in the consumer or pinned native source. Toolkit sets logical input range 0..65535 and disables autocenter; neither is evidence of a 1080-degree request. Compare physical travel, axis output and panel readout across controlled launch cases. |
| Wants a very light wheel with strong bumps/landing/crash feedback | KI-4 and feature request FR-2. Base Constant/Periodic/Spring/Damper at 100%, overall 80–90%; mod strength not given. Current output is one lateral-force/trail constant force with smoothing. Independent steering/effect gains require a new effects design, not a universal wheelbase preset. |
| Some jumps and crashes give little/no vibration, unlike PS5 rumble | FR-2. No dedicated landing/crash/road vibration channel is currently shipped. Investigate available event signals and contact transitions before promising effects. |
| TSS can change gears but cannot be assigned as a handbrake through stock controls | KI-13. Mod already supports a separately bound Handbrake axis and supplies a 0..1 float to the game's handbrake input. Document the direct-input path, then verify actual TSS intermediate travel and game response. |
| Asks whether analog handbrake is possible | Analog input is implemented; device support and downstream braking response still need attended confirmation. Do not promise a new physics model. |

The pasted message references Discord videos without a direct URL. GitHub issue
#1 independently supplies a [Discord message link](https://discord.com/channels/408108350052630540/1496625082682839120/1496625139847135274)
and two video links. Their media was not reviewed in this audit; no video findings
are inferred.

## T300/TSS follow-up — received 2026-09-08

Same reporter; exact build still unspecified. Both wheel and TSS use separate
USB cables. The TSS is visible to the mod and can shift, but the reporter has not
confirmed assigning its axis through **Wheel input (direct) → Handbrake**. This
supports investigating that binding path rather than adding a virtual controller.

- Rotation: after changing 1080 back to 700 in the driver panel during play, it
  stays 700. No measured physical travel or axis A/B was supplied (KI-12).
- Feel: prefers this mod's cornering/sliding forces to x360ce, but wants lighter
  steering with stronger landing/crash feedback (FR-2). Telemetry is a separate
  outgoing data path and does not add wheel effects. Shared mixer/event research
  remains applicable; current force defaults and pipeline are unchanged.
- Performance: rare, patternless frame-rate drops after longer play (KI-19),
  not established as the earlier stage-start symptom or a mod regression.
- Support UI: asks whether detailed logging must precede reproduction and file
  creation. Help now describes enable → brief repro → pause → bundle → disable;
  normal logs are available without the switch. New aggregate counters, recent
  log limits and input/mod inventory make the next report more useful.
- Assist: asks whether the mod checkbox temporarily changes game assist 20→0→20.
  Code does not implement that contract (KI-17); the numeric option is unidentified.
- Camera: explicitly uses thoxx's Nexus CameraMod, whose list/index assumptions
  conflict with our mounts (KI-18). The candidate now isolates its rotation.

The supplied unlisted x360ce setup and chase-camera videos were sampled
visually in the browser. The supplied 7:24 timestamp is near the setup video's
end; earlier samples show x360ce controller/force configuration. The other clip
shows close third-person driving and the separate lever. No torque, frame timing,
current mod build or complete driver preset was established from those samples.
No video download or complete narrated transcript was obtained.

## Camera controls without a numpad — FR-1 (original request)

Separate feature request supplied by the owner: allow camera control buttons to
be remapped for keyboards without a numpad. `Settings.cs` already stores 11
`KeyCode` fields and `CameraTuner` reads them, but the panel only exposes the
numpad toggle and fixed help text in 0.2.3. The work is a binding UI, conflict handling,
clear help and persistence, preserving existing defaults/settings. It concerns
mounted-view tuning; the game's ChangeCamera binding remains separate. Keyboard
remapping addresses the reported need; wheel/controller button support would
need additional input binding design.

An interim XML example and its limits are in [CAMERA.md](CAMERA.md).

## Draft follow-ups — not sent

### GitHub #1 — updated 2026-09-27 draft

Thanks for the report and the PS5-controller workaround. Since 0.2.3,
switching from our bonnet/bumper views back to stock cameras restores the
stock camera transform; 0.2.6 includes that fix. We have not reproduced the
PS5-pad interaction itself. If you try 0.2.6 with the pad connected, do stock
views 3–8 still face backward? If so, please share a new support file and your
ChangeCamera binding. Leave the issue open for that comparison unless new
evidence shows the pad-attached case also works.

The owner's separate triple-screen tests observed a working finish-camera
handoff in the triple-screen adapter. They do not establish stock views 3–8
with a PS5 pad attached, and they predate the
final-labelled 0.2.6 install. Do not treat them as that exact issue's pass.

### GitHub #1

Thanks for reporting the PS5-controller workaround. Version 0.2.3 is now available
and also fixes camera restoration when switching out of our mounted views and
when the game takes over for replays or stage end. Your workaround may describe
a separate input-binding problem. When convenient, please check the stock camera
views on 0.2.3, including with the pad connected if you can reproduce it. Please
check what the game's ChangeCamera action is bound to and include a new support
file if the problem returns. Let us know whether another camera mod is active.

### T300/TSS setup and feel

Thanks for the detailed setup report. For the TSS, open Ctrl+F10, expand Wheel
input (direct), enable Read the wheel directly, and select Assign on Handbrake
while the lever is released. Pull it, then use its full travel once to calibrate.
The mod supports an analog handbrake axis; you can leave working steering and
pedal channels unbound in this section. The upcoming 0.2.4 adds a displayed live
value and corrects Flip; on 0.2.3 reassign from the released position instead of
using pedal Flip. In the candidate, verify gradual values and return to zero.

The current FFB is a steering-force signal. It has no dedicated landing/crash
rumble channel, so lowering Strength also lowers any detail already in that
signal. Independent steering weight and effect gains are now on the roadmap.

We have not confirmed what changes the rotation readout from 700 to 1080 degrees.
Please include your mod version, Thrustmaster driver/firmware versions and whether
the physical wheel travel changes, ideally comparing the same launch with and
without the mod. A support file will help identify the exact loaded build and
devices. There is no confirmed rotation fix or TSS hardware result yet.
