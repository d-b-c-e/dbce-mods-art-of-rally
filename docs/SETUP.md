# Setup guide

Start with the [four install steps](../README.md#install). This guide covers
custom folders, controls and optional rig setup for **0.2.7**. The settings have
Simple and Advanced views, with Controls, FFB, Cameras, Telemetry and Help pages.
Pause before changing devices or bindings. [Local deployment](LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md)
identifies the owner's exact installed build.

## Check the installation

Launch through Steam, press **F6** for Wheel settings or **Ctrl+F10** for UMM,
and find **art of sim rally 0.2.7**. If the entry is absent or red, follow
[installation troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#installation-or-settings-panel-missing).

The game folder contains `artofrally.exe`. Our mod goes in
`Mods/ArtOfSimRally`; there should not be a nested `Mods/Mods` folder.
Keep the extracted download if you want to use its uninstaller later.

## Custom game folder

Steam: right-click art of rally in your Library → **Manage → Browse local files**
to find the folder containing `artofrally.exe`.

If automatic detection fails, open PowerShell in the **extracted download** and run:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1 -GameDir "D:\Games\artofrally"
```

Replace the example with your actual folder. Add `-Uninstall` to remove the mod.
This also supplies a path for non-Steam installs, but those game builds have not
been confirmed compatible. UMM must be installed for the selected game first.

## Installing through UMM

With the game closed and UMM installed for **Art of Rally**, drag the **mod ZIP**
onto UMM's **Mods** tab. The archive includes the `ArtOfSimRally` folder at its
root. This is an alternative to `Install.bat`; choose one installation route.

The ZIP includes the native FFB DLL beside the mod. `Install.bat` also installs
a copy in `artofrally_Data/Plugins/x86_64`. Both locations are intentional.
If switching from the batch installer to UMM, prefer the batch installer for
updates so both copies stay in sync. Vortex installation has not been validated.

## Updates, removal and settings

- **Update:** close the game, extract the new release into a fresh folder, and
  run `Install.bat`. It replaces mod files and verifies their hashes. Existing
  `Settings.xml`, other user files and the game's bindings are preserved.
- **Remove:** close the game and run `Uninstall.bat` from the extracted download.
  It removes our payload and native plugin copy, leaving settings and other mods.
  UMM is left installed. The revised installer can also remove our mod after UMM
  has already been removed; the original 0.2.5 installer requires UMM present.
- **Back up settings:** with the game closed, copy
  `Mods/ArtOfSimRally/Settings.xml` somewhere outside the game folder. Restore it
  with the game closed. Game-menu bindings are stored separately by the game.

## Wheel and pedals

1. Connect the wheel and pedals and verify they respond in the manufacturer's
   Windows software. Use the real USB wheel rather than routing it through a
   virtual Xbox controller.
2. In the game, pause and open **F6 → FFB**. Choose **On**. **Follow steering
   binding** uses the wheel saved in this mod's Controls page; if steering is
   bound only in the game's controls, choose the physical FFB wheel explicitly.
   Keep the game focused and allow a few seconds for setup. Use **Refresh devices**
   after reconnecting a wheel.
3. Keep the game's control bindings if they work. For missing axes, open
   **Controls** and choose **Use assigned controls**.
4. Centre the wheel or release the pedal. Click **Bind** beside **Steering**,
   **Throttle**, **Brake** or an expanded **Clutch** row, move only that control,
   and exercise its full range. Check the preview and inversion/deadzone, then
   **Save calibration**. Cancel or a failed save keeps the prior assignment.
5. Drive slowly first. If steering input is reversed, invert **Steering** in
   Controls. If input is correct but force pulls away from centre, use
   **Advanced → FFB → Invert force direction** instead.

Only assigned direct-input rows replace the game's inputs. Different rows can
read different USB devices. Menus continue to use the keyboard or a pad.
If a saved device becomes unavailable, pause, reconnect it, and reassign if needed.
See [Fanatec guidance](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#fanatec-wheels-csl-dd-dd-pro-clubsport-dd-gt-dd-pc-and-compatibility-modes)
for duplicate device names and the limits of current hardware confirmation.

## Separate USB handbrake

TSS means **Thrustmaster TSS Handbrake**; it can also operate as a sequential
shifter. Select its handbrake mode in the device setup before assigning it here.

1. Pause and open **Controls**. Choose **Use assigned controls**.
2. With the lever released, click **Bind** on **Handbrake (axis)**, then pull it.
3. Move through full travel once, then release. Check the live preview at rest,
   partial pull and full pull: an axis should vary gradually from 0 to 100%.
   Adjust inversion if backwards, then **Save calibration**.
   **Bind** chooses a new device and axis; **Calibrate** adjusts the saved axis.
   If no candidate appears, check the status at the top of Controls while still
   paused. Keep **Use assigned controls** On when driving with a separate lever.
4. Leave working wheel/pedal rows unbound. Clear conflicting game or separate
   shifter bindings if pulling the handbrake also shifts gear.

An axis binding is analog; a button is on/off. Seeing the TSS as **button 2**
in the Shifter panel only confirms a button, not analog travel. **No profile**
describes the game's recognition and does not mean the mod cannot read it.
One T300/TSS user confirmed partial-travel preview and working handbrake using
saved bindings in 0.2.6. Fresh 0.2.6 binding on that rig needs retesting.

## Steering force and landing vibration

| Setting | What to expect |
|---|---|
| **Strength**, default 50 | Overall steering force. Lower it for a lighter wheel. |
| **Smoothing**, default 0.20 | Higher values soften rapid force changes/rattle and add delay. It filters FFB, not steering input. |
| **Landing vibration**, default on | A short wheel vibration at a qualifying touchdown. Saved opt-outs remain off. |
| **Landing strength**, default 5 | Independent wheel vibration strength; smaller landings use less. Zero disables it. Range 0–40. |

Steering force fades in between 3 and 12 km/h. Landing vibration requires wheel
sine-effect support; if unsupported, steering can still work. Small hops may not
trigger it. [Details and limitations](LANDING-EFFECTS.md).

**Crash kick (experimental):** [How it works](CRASH-EFFECTS.md). It
is off by default, with independent strength **50** and range **0–100**. Enable
while paused for testing. It requests a short constant-force push, then releases;
hardware-specific feel still needs feedback. Landing and crash effects do not stack.
A wheel that rejects constant crash effects can still use landing vibration.

Landing remains strength **5**, range **0–40**. Both controls are percentages of
nominal wheel force: saved values are preserved, so select 50 manually to compare
the new crash default. Increase gradually if needed. A setting of 100 requests
full nominal force but does not guarantee headroom alongside steering. These
controls affect wheel effects; the wheelbase driver's global game FFB gain scales
them too. SimHub motion and ButtKicker gains are separate.

**Shift vibration (experimental):** off by default. In Advanced > FFB, enable
it to request a short wheel rumble when the player's gear engages. It starts at
5% nominal force with a 0–20% range, independent of steering strength. It does
not change shifting or gamepad rumble. Landing and crash cues take priority;
check the feel on your own wheel before leaving it enabled. This feature first
appears in 0.2.7; it has not been accepted on a physical wheel yet.

Leave **Disable steering limiter on car spawn (legacy)** off. It is not a live
override of the game's assist slider; use the game's assist settings instead.

## Shifter

While paused, open **Controls → Show shifter bindings**, enable **Separate
shifter**, choose the device and H-pattern or sequential mode, then **Bind**
each gear/shift action and
move the lever. A shifter can be a separate USB device. If a gate also brakes
or accelerates, clear that conflicting binding in the game's controls.

## Cameras

Press the game's change-view button to cycle to bonnet and bumper views.
These are external mounts; the cars do not have modelled cockpit interiors.

| Default numpad keys | Action |
|---|---|
| 8 / 2 | Forward / back |
| 9 / 3 | Up / down |
| 4 / 6 | Left / right |
| 7 / 1 | Tilt forward (look down) / tilt back (look up) |
| + / - | Widen / narrow field of view |
| 5 | Reset active mount |

Each press moves one step (default 2 cm, 1° tilt, 2° field of view); hold a key
to repeat. Change the steps in **Advanced → Cameras**; **Default steps** puts
them back. If your saved keys were exactly the old defaults (8/2 up-down, 9/7
forward-back, 1/3 tilt, 0 reset), they move to this layout on the next launch;
keys you changed yourself are kept.

No numpad? Use **Cameras → Show adjustment bindings** to bind keyboard keys or
separate USB buttons. Choose keys that
do not overlap driving controls. Close the panel and release held keys before
tuning. Adjustments save when paused or otherwise idle.

If Nexus **CameraMod** is loaded, it keeps its chase views and our mounts/tuning
are suspended. Disable it before a fresh launch to use our mounts. This does
not resolve every camera compatibility case; see [known issues](KNOWN-ISSUES.md).

## SimHub and ButtKicker

Skip this section if you only use wheel FFB. Telemetry is off by default and
does not change the wheel force settings.

1. Open SimHub and select **Forza Horizon 5** as the receiving game. Use its
   game/UDP settings to check the listening port is **8000**.
2. In art of rally, pause and open **Telemetry**. Choose **On**. For the same PC,
   select **Use local preset** (127.0.0.1:8000). For another PC, use
   **Advanced → Edit connection** and enter that PC's local network address and
   matching port; **Apply connection** saves host and port together.
3. Apply setup while paused, then start a stage. Confirm the mod's packet count
   increases and SimHub's speed/RPM respond. A sending counter alone does not
   prove receipt. Art of rally supplies the packets; Forza itself does not need
   to be installed or running.
4. For a ButtKicker, use SimHub's **ShakeIt Bass Shakers** effects, including
   **Impacts** and **Road impacts**. No companion plugin is needed. Tune their
   frequency and gain separately from wheel Landing strength. The owner's rig
   produced a more distinct thud at **30 Hz**; other rigs may differ. If the
   amplifier's CLIP indicator lights, reduce gain rather than raising it.

Choose a free port and change both ends if another application already listens
on 8000. Changes made while driving wait for pause. General receiving/port help
is in [SimHub's official guide](https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/SimHub-Basics----Games-config-and-troubleshooting).
Our [telemetry reference](TELEMETRY.md) describes the exported data.
