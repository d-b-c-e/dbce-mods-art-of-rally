# Troubleshooting

Version 0.2.7 uses Simple/Advanced views with Controls, FFB, Cameras, Telemetry
and Help pages. Pause before changing a binding or device.

For initial setup, use the [setup guide](SETUP.md). If the mod loads, pause and
collect a support file: **F6 → Help → Create support file**. Attach it when
reporting a problem.

You can also use **F6 > Help > Submit GitHub Issue** while paused. Enter a
title and description and optionally select logs; only selected logs are read
when you choose **Review report**. Review the preview for private information
(redaction is best effort), tick **I reviewed this report**, then choose
**Open reviewed GitHub draft**. Check and submit the issue on GitHub. If asked,
manually attach the reviewed `support-report.txt` saved in a report folder on
your Desktop; attaching uploads it immediately. **Create support file** remains
available for the separate Desktop diagnostic file.

## Installation or settings panel missing

- **Missing Install.bat:** download `ArtOfSimRally-0.2.7.zip` from release
  **Assets**, not either **Source code** archive. Use **Extract All** before
  running it; keep the extracted files together.
- **Game not found:** [supply the folder containing artofrally.exe](SETUP.md#custom-game-folder).
- **UMM missing:** run Unity Mod Manager, select **Art of Rally**, check the game
  folder and click **Install**. Having UMM for another game is not enough.
- **Access denied or file in use:** close the game fully. Retry the installer;
  use **Run as administrator** only if the folder still denies access.
- **Package verification failed:** download again and extract into a new folder.
  Do not mix files from different releases or edit the manifest to bypass checks.
- **No mod entry / Ctrl+F10 does nothing:** launch through Steam and check UMM
  was installed into that same game folder. The mod should be at
  `Mods/ArtOfSimRally`, not `Mods/Mods/ArtOfSimRally`. After a game update, check
  UMM's install status again.
- **Red entry or an old version:** close the game and reinstall the full release.
  If the panel cannot export support, attach UMM's
  `artofrally_Data/Managed/UnityModManager/Log.txt` from the game folder to an issue.

The installer checks UMM's file is present; the in-game version/load check
confirms whether the mod actually loaded. Use UMM **0.27.0 or newer**, as required
by the mod's `Info.json`.

## Collecting an intermittent slowdown or FFB report

Normal errors/settings/devices can be collected with **Log detail for support**
off. For extra force detail, enable it **before** a short reproduction, then
pause and create the support file in that same session, before restarting.
Turn detailed logging off afterward. Include build, driver/firmware, car/stage,
approximate event time and other active mods. Log tails cannot recover an entire
earlier drive or show why an FPS drop occurred.

**Log detail for support** is in **Advanced → Help**. Attach
the generated `art-of-sim-rally-support-*.txt` file from your Desktop.

Version 0.2.5 retains a small diagnostic summary at idle/normal exit and
includes it in the next support file as **previous session** evidence. Its build
and timestamp may differ from the current session. A crash can lose measurements
since the last idle save; collecting immediately after the hitch is still best.

Version 0.2.4 adds aggregate foreground-driving frame intervals, including
100 ms+ counts early/later in each driving segment. A segment also restarts after
pause/focus return; it is not a stage identifier. These counters write no files
per frame and are separate from the developer recorder. Existing force traces
still add logging overhead, so an off/on comparison can be useful. Support creation
now waits for you to pause; file reading/writing can itself stall the main thread.
Recent log windows are explicitly bounded/truncated, and the bundle lists loaded
mods plus cached input values. Export soon after the event to retain useful tails.

Version 0.2.6 additionally counts 33/50/100 ms intervals in the
first five seconds, next ten seconds and later driving. Counts overlap and depend
on your frame cap; a 30 fps cap naturally produces many 33 ms frames. These are
clues to when a slowdown occurred, not a diagnosis. For early landing reports,
the same support toggle adds last-event contact/compression timing. A short video
is still needed to compare with visible touchdown. Enable support logging before
the run, reproduce once, then pause and export before quitting.

The 0.2.6 native toolkit no longer traces every steering-force update by
default; initialization and errors are still logged. Advanced native tracing
requires `DBCE_FFB_TRACE_FORCE=1` in the game process environment before launch;
it is separate from **Log detail for support**, and is not needed for this normal
support procedure. It adds synchronous disk I/O, so leave it off for performance
comparisons. Restart to change it; an already-running Steam client does not inherit
variables set in another shell. `DBCE_FFB_LOG=0` remains the master native-log switch.

## Fanatec wheels (CSL DD, DD Pro, ClubSport DD, GT DD; PC and compatibility modes)

Fanatec bases present to Windows as **two devices with the same name**,
`FANATEC Wheel`. That causes three distinct problems, each with its own fix.

**1. The game's controls screen never responds to the wheel.**
The game's input library (Rewired, Raw Input backend) cannot read either
device — both show as 32 axes / 144 buttons and never report a movement, in PC
or compatibility mode. No binding trick fixes this; the mod reads the wheel
itself instead.

- F6 → **Controls** → choose **Use assigned controls**.
- **Steering → Bind**, then turn the wheel both ways. Bind Throttle and Brake
  separately; expand Clutch if needed. Check inversion/deadzone and preview,
  then **Save calibration** for each row. A handbrake button has its own row.
- Drive. Explicit calibration keeps the saved range; use the row's **Calibrate**
  action to change it.
- Menus still use the keyboard or a gamepad; that is expected.

**2. Force feedback is dead, or was dead until 0.2.2.**
Only one of the two `FANATEC Wheel` devices has the motor. Picking the other
one in the FFB device selector used to fail silently. From 0.2.2 the mod tries
each available force-feedback device before giving up. With duplicate names,
bind Steering in Controls and use **Follow steering binding**, or explicitly
select the verified FFB device; do not infer that either same-name entry is the
motor without checking its identity and status. If force direction is wrong,
use **Advanced → FFB → Invert force direction**.

**3. Choosing a shifter crashed the game (before 0.2.2).**
Fixed. It happened only when force feedback had failed to initialise, which on
a Fanatec was the wrong-twin case above.

**Pedals on a separate USB cable** (ClubSport V3 etc.) appear as their own
device and are read the same way: Bind, press the pedal, check the preview,
then Save calibration.

## Separate handbrake (TSS or other USB device)

### Bindings do not detect a wheel, pedal or separate handbrake

Pause the stage first; opening Wheel settings alone does not pause it. In
**Controls**, keep **Use assigned controls** On for a separate USB handbrake.
**Bind** chooses a device/axis: start released or centred, move just that
control through full travel, release, then choose **Save calibration**.
**Calibrate** adjusts the already saved axis. Check the status at the top of
Controls if no device appears. The game may still drive through its own
wheel/pedal assignments even when the mod's assigned controls are Off; that
does not establish that the TSS binding is active. If binding still fails,
create a support file **before reinstalling or clearing settings**, and include
the pause state, status text, device mode, and whether the preview moves.
The 0.2.6 T300/TSS fresh-bind report, still awaiting a TSS retest in 0.2.7, is tracked as
[KI-43](KNOWN-ISSUES.md#ki-43--026-binding-and-calibration-may-not-capture-a-separate-tss-handbrake).

Version 0.2.5 identifies newly assigned axes/buttons by device instance GUID
and retries unavailable readers while paused. If an old binding reports identical
devices, pause and use Bind again for that row. Bind also discovers devices
plugged in after launch. Existing unambiguous bindings upgrade automatically after
a successful read; their calibration is preserved. Hardware validation is pending.
For a separate shifter, pause before choosing its device. Version 0.2.5 also
retains that selection by GUID; reconnect/reselect if it reports unavailable.
Old identical-name selections need an explicit choice. Automatic native shifter
hotplug recovery remains unverified.

Use the mod's binding panel if the game's controls screen only offers shifting
or never detects the handbrake. You can bind just the handbrake and leave working
steering/pedal channels on the game's input path.

Version 0.2.4 adds live values and fixes Flip/reopen/assignment failures
(KI-15). If still using 0.2.3, prefer assigning from a released lever and using full
travel; pedal Flip has a known defect. Live numeric values below are a 0.2.4 addition.

1. Pause with the TSS in handbrake mode. Open F6 → **Controls** and choose
   **Use assigned controls**.
2. Release the lever, click **Bind** on **Handbrake (axis)**, then pull it. Avoid
   moving other controls during assignment.
3. Use the lever's full travel, then release it. Verify partial travel in the
   preview, adjust inversion if needed, and **Save calibration**. The value
   should move gradually from 0 to 100% and return to 0.
4. Leave unrelated direct-input rows unbound if their existing game bindings work.
   Clear conflicting shift bindings if pulling the lever also changes gear.

The direct axis supplies an analog float to the game; a button binding is on/off.
One T300/TSS user confirmed the analog preview and working handbrake with a
saved 0.2.5 binding on 0.2.6; fresh binding remains in investigation. If it
does not bind or shows only 0/1, create a support file and record the device mode,
binding and displayed values at rest, partial pull and full pull.

"No profile" describes the game's controller recognition, not whether direct
input can read the TSS. The Shifter section binds buttons, so seeing "button 2"
there alone does not establish whether the device also exposes an analog axis.

## The wheel steers the wrong way with direct input

In F6 → Controls, bind or recalibrate **Steering** and choose **Invert** if its
preview moves backwards. This changes input direction, not force direction.

## Force feedback too strong or too weak

Use **FFB → Strength** to adjust steering force; 50 is the default.
Force fades in between 3 and 12 km/h. Smoothing controls how quickly force
changes reach the wheel; keep it consistent when comparing builds.

At the default **0.20**, each force update blends 20% of the previous output with
80% of the new force. Zero is unfiltered. Higher values soften fast changes and
rattle, but also soften bumps and add response delay. Smoothing filters wheel
force, not steering input; it does not reduce a sustained force like Strength does.

Lowering Strength lowers steering-force detail too. The mod adds
independent [landing vibration](LANDING-EFFECTS.md), on by default at strength 5;
existing saved choices are preserved. Check its status while paused.
If setup or delivery fails, toggle it off/on while paused and export support.
Some drivers may reject sine effects; steering continues. The experimental
crash kick is separate, off by default in Advanced FFB. For a ButtKicker, use
[SimHub's built-in effects](SETUP.md#simhub-and-buttkicker);
wheel Landing strength does not change the shaker or telemetry.

## Settings explanations stay small when increasing Mod Manager scale

Version 0.2.4 fixed explanatory text at 11 pixels, regardless of UMM's scale.
Version 0.2.5 removed that override. In 0.2.6, **Help → Settings text size**
defaults to **Use UMM scale**; **Auto** can enlarge this mod's content on a
high-resolution screen. Resize the surrounding window in UMM Settings.

## Steering assist: does the mod temporarily replace the game's value?

No. The legacy **Disable steering assist** checkbox sets a boolean limiter off
when a car spawns, only with Direct steering enabled. It neither writes a numeric
game setting nor restores the current car on untick. 0.2.4 labels this limitation
explicitly. Leave it off and use the game's own assist controls; start a fresh
car/game session after removing a retained legacy override. Do not infer a numeric
"20 → 0 → 20" contract from the checkbox.

## Using Nexus Camera Mod for chase views

Version 0.2.4 detects loaded `CameraMod` and suspends our mounted views and
tuning keys, preserving its camera rotation and your saved mount settings. The
other mod assumes ownership of slots 8/9 and shares several numpad keys; running
both editors together can address the wrong camera. Disable CameraMod before a
fresh game launch to use our bonnet/bumper views. This is a compatibility guard,
not proof that it caused any particular prior camera or performance report.

## Force feedback stops after alt-tab (before 0.2.1)

Fixed: the wheel came back non-exclusively acquired and nothing re-acquired
it. If you still see it, the support file's force-feedback section will show
`0x80040205` counts; report it with the file.

## No force feedback at all

- In 0.2.3 and later support files, compare **build**, **mod sha256**, **mapped
  file** and **file sha256** with the release manifest. `preload requested` is
  only the path requested, not proof of which module was bound. Inspection does
  not load the plugin; `(not loaded)` may simply mean FFB/input is disabled.
- The installer intentionally puts UnityForceFeedback.dll in both the mod folder
  and Plugins/x86_64. **Do not delete a copy just because it is in Plugins.**
  If hashes differ, close the game and reinstall the complete package, then
  capture a fresh support file. Multiple resident modules are reported as ambiguous.
- Toolkit release and native-component versions use different sequences. Read
  both from the support file and the published package; a different number is
  expected. Older support files call the latter `native abi`, and their
  `loaded from` field only recorded the preload request.
- The support file's force-feedback section says whether the mod computed
  forces and whether the device refused them (`SetParameters FAILED`).
- Another program holding the wheel exclusively (a second game instance, a
  crashed one, some wheel utilities) blocks force feedback. Check Task Manager
  for a leftover `artofrally.exe`.
- The wheel's own software must be in PC mode with force feedback enabled.

## A stranded force after a crash

If the game dies with force applied, the base may keep pushing. Power-cycle the
base, or use the wheel software's stop-FFB control. Closing the game normally
zeroes the wheel first.

## Shifter gate maps to the throttle

The game auto-bound a shifter gate to an axis it took for the throttle. Reset
the game's own controls once (its options screen); the mod reads the shifter
directly and needs no game bindings.

## Gamepads, vJoy and virtual controllers

A virtual controller (vJoy, XOutput, ViGEm) can look exactly like a wheel to
the game and steal the force-feedback slot. Disable it while playing, or pick
the real wheel explicitly in the *Wheel* dropdown.

## The camera moves about at the end of a stage

Version 0.2.3 and later restore the stock camera when the game enters a replay or
results cinematic. Owner camera smoke testing passed, but the full transition
matrix remains incomplete. If it happens again, note which
mounted/stock view you used beforehand and attach a support file and short video.
For reversed stock views, also inspect the ChangeCamera binding and record whether
a PS5 controller is attached: that resolved issue #1's original reporter's symptom.
See [KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md) for the distinction between the report and
the camera handback defect.

## Telemetry stays off after a connection error

Check the host and UDP port in the mod panel. In 0.2.3 and later, correcting
the destination retries the connection; turning telemetry off and back on also
clears the failed state. An unchanged failing destination stays quiet instead of
repeating connection work every physics step. If it still fails, retain the error
from the support file and check the receiving application's host/port settings.
