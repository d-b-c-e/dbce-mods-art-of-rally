# Camera

For the current controls and remapping steps, see [camera setup](SETUP.md#cameras).
The sections below explain the design and preserve the implementation history.

## The accepted concession

**This is a bonnet camera, not a cockpit camera.** That is a decision, not a
gap to be closed later.

art of rally's cars have no modelled interiors — no dashboard, no wheel, no
pillars, no wipers. The world is authored to be seen from a distant isometric
camera, so at eye level you get LOD pop-in, low-detail near geometry, and
shadow cascades tuned for a viewpoint tens of metres away.

A cockpit view is therefore not a camera change, it is an art project: modelling
interiors for every car in the game. Out of scope.

What a bonnet or bumper mount *does* deliver is the thing that actually matters
for driving feel — the horizon moving with the suspension, the car rotating
about you, and a stable forward reference that lets you place the car by feel
instead of by reading a top-down sprite.

## What the game gives us

From [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md), `CarCameras` is an ordinary follow camera:

```
target  distance  height  yawAngle  initialPitchAngle  currentPitchAngle
MinFOV  MaxFOV  CurrentFOV  smoothTimeFOV  smoothTimeTilt
rotationDamping  heightDamping  yawResetSpeed  dampFixedCamera
CurrentCameraAngle  CameraAnglesList  cardynamics  myTransform  mtarget
```

A bonnet view is `distance` ≈ 0, `height` at bonnet level, pitch level, damping
near zero so the camera is rigid to the car rather than lagging it, and a
narrower FOV than the isometric default.

`CameraAngles` is `CAMERA1`..`CAMERA8`, and `Cinemachine.dll` ships with a
`cinemachineBrain` on `CameraManager`, so there is room to add a mode rather
than hijack an existing one.

There is **no** latent first-person mode to switch on — see the `FirstPerson`
dead end recorded in FINDINGS.md.

## Prior art

**0.2.4 compatibility behavior:** if UMM has loaded thoxx's `CameraMod`, our
mounted views/tuning are suspended for that setup. Its code assumes its added
views occupy indices 8/9 and edits by enum index; sharing the list can target the
wrong camera. Its default editor keys also overlap our numpad controls. The panel
explains the guard and preserves our settings. Disable CameraMod before a new game
launch to use our mounts. Combined-mod screen tests remain pending (KI-18).

The Nexus "Camera Mod" already adds extra perspectives and a small camera
editor via Unity Mod Manager. The approach is proven; the question is only
whether to build on it or implement independently. Building independently keeps
this repo's dependency surface to UMM + Harmony alone, and lets the camera share
the mod's settings UI with force feedback and telemetry.

## Design notes

- **Rigid, not damped.** The default camera's `rotationDamping` and
  `heightDamping` exist to smooth an isometric chase view. On a bonnet mount
  they read as the car sliding under a floating camera. Damping should go to
  near zero, with any smoothing reintroduced deliberately.
- **Suspension coupling is the whole point.** The camera must inherit body roll
  and pitch. `CarDynamics` and `Wheel.suspensionTravel` are right there.
- **Head movement under load** — a small lateral offset from lateral G — is what
  sells a bonnet cam. Keep it subtle and make it configurable to zero; it is
  also the first thing to make people motion-sick.
- **FOV with speed.** `MinFOV`/`MaxFOV`/`smoothTimeFOV` already exist and are
  already speed-driven for the chase camera; reuse rather than reimplement.
- **Expect to hide the car's own geometry** if the mount clips through it, and
  expect near-plane tuning.
- **Co-driver calls become essential.** With no top-down view of the road ahead,
  pace notes stop being flavour and start being the interface. Worth checking
  early whether the game's existing calls have enough lead time for a driver who
  can no longer see round the corner.

## Status

**Shipped.** The bonnet view landed in 0.2.0 and the bumper view beside it the
same day; both are in the game's own view rotation with a numpad tuner, and both
are verified on the owner's rig.

## Numpad layout and steps

Defaults follow the family layout (toolkit STD-005): 8/2 forward/back, 9/3
up/down, 4/6 left/right, 7/1 tilt forward (look down) / back (look up), +/−
field of view, 5 reset. A larger `BonnetPitch`/`BumperPitch` looks down, so
`KeyPitchDown` is on 7. Up to 0.4.0 the mod shipped 8/2 up-down, 9/7
forward-back, 1/3 tilt and 0 reset. On load, `CameraKeys.MigratePreviousDefaults`
moves a saved set that exactly equals that set (either tilt order) or the
family's interim set to the current layout, logs it and shows it once under
adjustment bindings; one changed key keeps the whole saved set.

Each press moves one step (STD-006): `CameraMoveStep` 0.02 m, `CameraTiltStep`
1°, `CameraFovStep` 2°, set in Advanced → Cameras with **Default steps**.
Holding repeats after 0.35 s every 0.1 s on real time (`CameraRepeat`), at most
one step per frame, without replaying steps after a stall. This replaced the
held speeds `TuneMoveSpeed` (0.4 m/s) and `TuneAngleSpeed` (20°/s); those XML
fields are now ignored. Feel at the rig is not yet confirmed.

## Keys without a numpad

The **0.2.4 release** implements in-panel keyboard remapping for all 11 actions:
Ctrl+F10 → Camera → Enable camera tuning keys → Rebind. It supports cancel, clear,
duplicate feedback and Restore numpad defaults, including with only bumper enabled.
Close the panel and release held keys before tuning. Modifier chords do not
activate single-key bindings. The panel and key delivery still need attended
validation; this feature ships in 0.2.4.

In 0.2.4, hotkey edits save once idle (for example paused), at least a second
after the last edit. The watchdog retains failed saves and retries even after
switching to stock view. Held keys no longer write a log per frame.

The 0.2.3 tuner already reads key fields
from `Mods/ArtOfSimRally/Settings.xml`. With the game closed, back up that file
and edit existing fields, for example:

```xml
<KeyUp>PageUp</KeyUp>
<KeyDown>PageDown</KeyDown>
```

This changes vertical adjustment for the active mounted view. Other fields are
KeyForward, KeyBack, KeyLeft, KeyRight, KeyPitchDown, KeyPitchUp, KeyFovUp,
KeyFovDown and KeyReset. Values must be valid Unity `KeyCode` names; choose keys
that do not conflict with your game bindings. These keys tune bonnet/bumper
position, not the game's ChangeCamera action or another mod's chase camera.
The XML route is supported by the existing settings model; the example has not
been exercised in an attended game session. Default mappings remain numpad keys.

## Implementation

Implementation is [`BonnetCamera.cs`](../src/ArtOfSimRally.Mod/BonnetCamera.cs)
and [`CameraTuner.cs`](../src/ArtOfSimRally.Mod/CameraTuner.cs). The mechanism is
smaller than the design notes above imply: `CarCameras.SetCameraFromSave` wraps
on `CameraAnglesList.Count` rather than a hard-coded 8, so appending entries in a
`Start` postfix is enough to join the rotation — no patching of the cycling logic
at all. A `LateUpdate` postfix then takes the camera over completely while one of
ours is active, because the stock rig always places the camera at a distance and
calls `LookAt` on the car, and a zero distance would have it looking at itself.

Of the design notes, two were followed exactly and one was not:

- **Rigid, not damped** — followed. No position or rotation damping at all.
- **Head movement under load** — followed, as `BonnetLean`, smoothed and
  configurable to zero.
- **FOV with speed** — *not* done. `UpdateFOVAndPitch` rewrites `fieldOfView`
  every frame for the chase camera, so the mounted views set a fixed FOV after
  it rather than reusing the speed curve. Nobody has asked for the curve.

### Open issues and RC handback

KI-1 and KI-2 are tracked in [KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md). The issue #1
reporter says removing a PS5 controller resolved their symptom; the stale child
transform is a separately established code defect, not a confirmed diagnosis of
that report.

The RC restores the owned camera child's local identity and prior FOV. Stock-view
handback may snap the parent; cinematic handback does not. CameraManager disables
CarCameras when enabling Cinemachine, so explicit transition prefixes and a
persistent watchdog cover paths where the LateUpdate postfix never runs.
Disabling an active mounted view returns to a usable stock angle. New rotation
entries still require a stage start if they were disabled when the stage loaded.

Offline ownership/callback tests pass. The rendered stock views, replay, finish,
restart and mod-disable transitions remain in the attended RC checklist.

## Bumper view

Added 2026-09-02 as a second entry in the same rotation, after the bonnet
view. It is the same mechanism — a `CameraAngle` appended in `CarCameras.Start`,
taken over in the `LateUpdate` postfix — with its own offsets (`BumperHeight`,
`BumperForward`, `BumperSide`, `BumperPitch`, `BumperFOV`), defaulting to just
above the front bumper looking down the road. `BonnetLean` is shared. The
numpad tuner adjusts whichever mounted view is on screen and the reset key
resets that view alone. Either view can be disabled independently; changes to
the rotation take effect on the next stage, when `CarCameras.Start` runs again.
