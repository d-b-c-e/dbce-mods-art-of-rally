# Controls and binding

For setup steps, start with [wheel/pedals](SETUP.md#wheel-and-pedals) or
[a separate USB handbrake](SETUP.md#separate-usb-handbrake). The reference below
includes the original game-input investigations and dated fixes.

**October 9 source candidate:** Wheelkit can translate axes/shifter fields and,
with the new package capability, camera/menu buttons and POV directions into
this mod's F6 XML. Read [the candidate scope and qualification limits](reviews/2026-10-09-profile-controls.md)
before relying on it; live post-Apply input qualification is still pending.

**Short answer: no binding utility is needed.** art of rally has a proper
native rebinding UI with split-axis support, and Rewired already recognises
most wheels. Verified from the shipped assemblies, 2026-08-31.

## The game's own binder

`ControlsRemapper` in `Assembly-CSharp.dll` is a complete press-to-bind system:

```
Poll  OnPollForElementAssignment  EndPolling
AssignElementToJoystickMap        AssignElementToKeyboardMap
isPollingPositiveSplitAxis        isPollingNegativeSplitAxis
RemoveExistingAxisAssignments     RemoveExistingButtonAssignments
DeleteExistingMapsForAction       RevertCurrentActionMap
RestoreDefaultControls            RefreshDisplayedMaps
JoystickConnected                 JoystickDisconnected
OnControllerAssignmentChangeEvent joystickCount  controlType
```

The two split-axis fields matter most for a wheel: the game can bind **each
half of an axis independently**, which is what combined pedal sets need and
which proves pedals are not modelled as gamepad triggers.

`controlType` with `NextControlType` / `PreviousControlType` means multiple
control schemes, and the `JoystickConnected` / `JoystickDisconnected` handlers
mean hot-plug is handled rather than requiring a restart.

## Rewired's wheel database - and what is NOT in it

`Rewired.IRacingWheelTemplate` is present, so a *recognised* wheel maps onto a
standard racing-wheel element set - steering, throttle, brake, clutch,
handbrake, shifter - rather than anonymous numbered axes.

Genuine hardware-map entries in this build, each with a real GUID and VID/PID:

> Logitech G25 / G27 / G29 / G920 / G923 / Driving Force, Thrustmaster T150 /
> T300RS / TMX / T-GT, Fanatec Porsche 911 Turbo S

**Moza is not among them.** An earlier version of this document claimed it was;
that was a false positive from grepping the assets for "Moza", which matched
**Mozambique** in the country localisation table. The Rewired build shipped here
predates Moza's wheelbases entirely.

### Verified case: MOZA R12 Base

DirectInput sees the base perfectly well (`tools/dinput-enum`):

```
[2] MOZA R12 Base            VID_346E&PID_0006
    type          : 1STPERSON            <- not DRIVING
    axes/buttons  : 8 axes, 128 buttons, 1 POV
    FORCE FEEDBACK: YES
        axis: X Axis   [FFB actuator]
        axis: Y Axis   [FFB actuator]
```

Rewired also sees it and creates a joystick map for it - but unrecognised:

```
hardwareIdentifier = WindowsRawInputMOZAR12Base0006346E
hardwareGuid       = 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

The all-zero `hardwareGuid` is the signature of an Unknown Controller: no
hardware map matched, so no Racing Wheel Template, no element names, no glyphs.
Note the backend is **Raw Input**, not DirectInput.

### Symptom, and what it turned out to be — RESOLVED

Observed 2026-08-31: the controls screen offered only "keyboard" and
"joystick", and rebinding produced no response from the wheel.

`ControlsRemapper` exposes `joystick` (singular), `activeController` and
`joystickCount` — it targets **one device at a time**, and it only ever binds
`Joysticks[0]`. With three joysticks connected here (DS-8X Shifter, MOZA R12
Base, MOZA Multi-function Stalk) whichever one sorted first won, and the wheel
produced nothing.

Fixed by `BindAnyDevice`, which retargets the remapper at whichever device you
actually touch. Shipped in 0.1.0 and verified. The deadzone finding below is a
*second*, independent cause of "the wheel feels wrong" and was fixed separately.

### CONFIRMED root cause: Rewired's hidden 10% axis deadzone

Measured in game on 2026-08-31, MOZA R12 Base. The mod logs every axis before
touching it:

```
Rewired calibration for 'MOZA R12 Base' (recognised=False)
  before: [0] dz=0.100 sens=1.00  [1] dz=0.100 ...  (all 32 axes)
  after : [0] dz=0.000 sens=1.00  [1] dz=0.000 ...
```

**Rewired applies a 10% deadzone to every axis of an unrecognised controller.**
On a wheel set to 270 degrees that is +/-13.5 degrees - a 27 degree dead band
at centre.

There are two independent deadzones, and the options screen only reaches one:

1. **The game's.** `AxisCarController.GetInput` calls
   `ProcessDeadzoneForInput(GetAxisRaw(steerAxis), SettingsManager.GetSteeringDeadzone())`.
   That function is a plain cutoff and does nothing at 0. This is what the UI sets,
   and it is innocent.
2. **Rewired's.** `AxisCalibration.deadZone`, applied *inside* `GetAxisRaw`
   before the game sees a number - "raw" means unsmoothed, not uncalibrated.
   Nothing in the game's UI exposes it, and an unrecognised device has no
   hardware profile to override the 0.1 default.

This is why the wheel feels fine in every other game: they do not route it
through Rewired's unrecognised-device defaults.

Fixed by `WheelCalibration` in the mod, which zeroes the deadzone and forces
linear sensitivity. Reported as a large improvement in feel.

Because Rewired's shipped database predates every modern direct-drive base,
this very likely affects Moza, Simagic, Simucube, Fanatec DD and Asetek users
equally - not just this one wheel.

### Options considered, and what shipped

1. ~~Cycle the remapper to the MOZA R12 Base.~~ Superseded: `BindAnyDevice`
   retargets it automatically.
2. ~~Moza Pit House compatibility settings.~~ Not needed, and not something a
   mod can ask every user to do.
3. ~~**Register a Rewired hardware map** for the R12 (`346E:0006`) with a
   Racing Wheel Template.~~ Well-scoped, and it would have given real axis
   names — but it fixes exactly one VID/PID. `WheelCalibration` zeroing the
   deadzone gets the same driving result for *every* unrecognised device, which
   is most modern direct-drive bases, so that is what shipped.

For devices Rewired cannot read at all, none of the three would have helped;
see "read the wheel directly" below. A binding utility remains the wrong answer
either way — see the xoutput section.

### Raw Input vs DirectInput — tried at runtime, abandoned (2026-09-02/03)

Rewired supports several Windows backends (`Rewired.InputSource` in
`Rewired_Core.dll`): `DirectInput = 1`, `XInput = 2`, `RawInput = 5`, and
others. art of rally runs **Raw Input** — saved binding keys are prefixed
`WindowsRawInput...`. Raw Input parses HID reports itself and has two failure
modes seen in the wild:

- **Devices it never lists.** Shifters and stalks report as supplemental HID
  devices, not joysticks; the game logs "found 1 joysticks attached" while
  joy.cpl shows three.
- **Devices it lists but cannot read.** A Fanatec direct-drive base (support
  bundle, 2026-09-02) appears twice as `FANATEC Wheel` with *identical*
  hardware ids and 32 axes / 144 buttons — Rewired's ceiling for a descriptor
  it failed to parse. Both entries are assigned to the player, nothing is
  bound, and the controls screen never sees an element move, so no binding
  fix can help. DirectInput on the same machine reads them as 8 axes / 108
  buttons and 12 / 63, distinct.

`ReInput.configuration.windowsStandalonePrimaryInputSource` has a runtime
setter, and it calls Rewired's `ResetAll()` — a full teardown and rebuild of
controllers, assignments and maps. A first attempt (2026-09-01) applied it
during mod load and killed the keyboard with no in-game way back; it was
removed twice without the cause being established. The instrumented re-test
on 2026-09-02 (every keypress probed through `UnityEngine.Input` and through
Rewired independently) established what matters:

| Applied after the title screen is up | Result |
|---|---|
| Keyboard, 15 presses under DirectInput | seen by Unity and by Rewired, every one |
| Saved keyboard maps | intact (3 before, 3 after) |
| Joysticks enumerated | 1 on Raw Input (base) → 3 on DirectInput (base, stalk, DS-8X) |
| Switching back in-process | works; Raw Input bindings return |

That looked like the whole story, and was not. Applied later in the same
session from the settings panel — and then again at the title screen with the
switch pre-armed — the switch left the **menus** dead while every probe said
input was flowing: 30 and then 67 keypresses seen by Unity, by Rewired's
keyboard controller *and* by the player's actions (`UISubmit`, `UICancel`,
`UIHorizontal` all firing), keyboard maps enabled and identical, Rewired's UI
input module alive with player 0. The game's own log showed 48,216 "object
created by a previous session ... no longer valid" errors — stale Rewired
objects cached by game code (`ControllerButtonDisplay`, `Arcader`) — and
refreshing all 84 of them brought the count to zero without bringing the
menus back. Whatever else `ResetAll()` breaks in this game's menu code was
not found, and after four attempts across two days it was abandoned.
**The switch stays in the code as an experiment reachable only through
`UseDirectInputBackend` in Settings.xml; it is not in the panel.**

### The fix that shipped: read the wheel directly (2026-09-03)

Instead of making Rewired see the device, the mod stops needing Rewired for
the wheel. The native plugin already enumerates every DirectInput controller
for the shifter; `OpenReadDevice` / `ReadDeviceState` open each one
non-exclusively for reading (the force-feedback wheel is read through the
exclusive handle already held) with axes requested in 0..65535.
`WheelInput` binds Steer, Throttle, Brake, Clutch and Handbrake to an axis or
button by "Assign, then move it": the value at rest and the value it moved
to are recorded, the far end keeps extending as the control is used. Steering
assignment is direction-independent (lower raw values negative, higher positive;
use Flip if the device is reversed), and pedals map rest
to 0 and the moved direction to 1 (so pedals that idle at the top of their
range work too). A postfix on `AxisCarController.GetInput` writes bound
channels over the game's values after its own deadzone processing and keeps
the steering-alignment effect, so direct steering, steer assist and telemetry
all see what they would from a wheel Rewired understood. Unbound channels
are untouched; menus still use keyboard or pad.

Verified 2026-09-03 on the MOZA rig: all three controllers open, the base
reads through the FFB handle (steering centred at 32669), pedals on the base
at rest. Driven on the owner's rig 2026-09-03: steering, throttle and brake through
the direct read, once the steering assignment was made direction-independent
(a left turn during Assign had made left positive). Fanatec verification is
still outstanding — [KI-3](KNOWN-ISSUES.md#ki-3--fanatec-fixes-are-unverified-on-fanatec-hardware).

### Version 0.2.5 identity and recovery

Direct channels may come from different USB devices. A new assignment stores
`device|index|axis:N|rest|far|guid:<instance-guid>` (or `button:N`). Legacy
five-field bindings remain readable and migrate after a successful, unambiguous
read. Missing strict GUIDs stay neutral; same-name ambiguity requires Assign.
Calibration and Flip retain the identity. Malformed GUIDs never trigger fallback.

Reader recovery/discovery runs at most every five seconds while idle, including
when another reader remains open. Begin Assign while paused to refresh a newly
plugged device. Resuming cancels an unfinished assignment. Binding edits and
learned endpoints persist when idle, retaining failed-write retries.

The separate shifter picker stores `ShifterDeviceGuid`, resolves it against a
fresh list before opening, and upgrades a unique legacy device name. An old
index alone is insufficient to identify a shifter. Reopen clears gear latches;
native automatic shifter hotplug recovery is not claimed. All these changes
have offline coverage; hardware and same-name TSS/Fanatec tests remain pending.

### Why the device presents unusually

DirectInput's hard ceiling is 8 axes, 128 buttons and 4 POV hats. The R12
reports **exactly 8 axes and 128 buttons** - it saturates the envelope, because
Moza aggregates base, rim, pedals and accessories into a single HID device.
That is also why DirectInput classifies it `1STPERSON` rather than `DRIVING`.
There are widespread reports of Moza buttons above index 32 going undetected in
various games, which is the same root cause seen from a different angle.

### This does not block force feedback

Force feedback goes through DirectInput, which reports the R12 with FFB
actuators on X and Y — a direct match for `SetDeviceForcesXY`. Binding trouble
and FFB are independent problems, and that has held up in practice: force
feedback shipped and works on devices whose input Rewired cannot read at all.

## Where bindings persist

`Rewired.Data.UserDataStore_PlayerPrefs` — Unity PlayerPrefs, which on Windows
is the registry:

```
HKCU\Software\Funselektor Labs\art of rally
```

It saves controller maps, player data, input behaviours **and joystick
calibration** (`LoadJoystickCalibrationData`), so deadzones, axis ranges and
inversion survive restarts.

That key was absent when this project started, which is how "the game has never
been launched on this machine" was established. It exists now. Deleting it is
the clean way to reset every binding and calibration the game holds — the mod's
own settings live in UMM's `Settings.xml` and are untouched by that.

## Do NOT route the wheel through xoutput / XInput

This was considered as a fallback and is rejected, because it would break force
feedback rather than help it.

Presenting the wheel as a virtual XInput gamepad costs three things:

1. Axis resolution drops to gamepad precision.
2. Separate pedal axes collapse into triggers.
3. **XInput has no force feedback beyond rumble motors.**

The entire FFB route in this project goes through DirectInput — the missing
`UnityForceFeedback.dll` opens a DirectInput device and creates a constant
force effect (see [FORCE-FEEDBACK.md](FORCE-FEEDBACK.md)). Hiding the real
device behind a virtual pad hides it from exactly the API the mod needs.

Native DirectInput is both the better input path and the only one where force
feedback is possible at all.

## Settings that live outside the game

- **Rotation range (900°/1080°)** is configured in the wheel's own driver — G
  HUB, Fanatec control panel, Thrustmaster panel. Note though that
  `Assembly-CSharp.dll` binds `LogiSetPreferredControllerProperties`, so the
  game *can* set operating range itself for Logitech wheels.
- **H-shifter**: `LogiGetShifterMode` is bound, so Logitech shifter mode is
  understood natively.

## Verified with real hardware (2026-08-31 onwards)

All four questions this section originally posed are answered:

1. The wheel shows as an **Unknown Controller** — all-zero `hardwareGuid`, no
   Racing Wheel Template, no element names, no glyphs.
2. Throttle and brake **do** bind as separate axes; the split-axis polling
   works as the assemblies suggested.
3. `HKCU\Software\Funselektor Labs\art of rally` appears once bindings are
   written, and holds calibration as well as maps.
4. Multi-device **is** anticipated and does work, but only one device at a time
   is bindable through the stock screen — hence `BindAnyDevice`, and hence the
   shifter and wheel being read directly rather than bound.

What is *not* verified is any of this on a Fanatec base, which is the one class
of device known to defeat Rewired entirely. See
[KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md).

## Related risk — settled

The FFB plugin needs `DISCL_EXCLUSIVE` on the wheel while Rewired already holds
it for input. This works: DirectInput permits the exclusive acquire alongside
Rewired's non-exclusive one, on this stack and on every user stack reported so
far. Losing the foreground *does* return the device non-exclusively, which is a
different problem with its own fix — see "fighting Rewired for the device" and
the `0x80040205` section in [FORCE-FEEDBACK.md](FORCE-FEEDBACK.md).
