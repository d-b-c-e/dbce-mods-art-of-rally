# Development signal capture

Recording and replay are development tools only. The recorder is a separate UMM mod
(`tools/testing/Recorder`, `ArtOfSimRally.DevRecorder.dll`, packaged on its own by
`tools/package/session-tools.ps1`). It is never in the player ZIP and has no row in the
F6 panel; `package.ps1` fails if the mod assembly contains recorder code.

The removable developer probe 0.2.5.4 now writes schema 4. Install and control it using
[TEST-DRIVE.md](TEST-DRIVE.md). Nothing starts automatically; no recorder is
installed by the release package. The replay executable runs without Unity, the
game or a wheel, and never emits hardware force.

Replay also reports `frameIntervalWindows`: realtime intervals between consecutive
driving frames, split into first 5s/next 10s/later, with nested >=33.33/50/100 ms
counts. It excludes entry/resume gaps, using the production aggregate policy.
Unlike live frame health, old captures lack focus/stage identifiers; a segment
is not necessarily a cold start. Existing `delta_s` timing summaries remain
unchanged. Compare frame caps and avoid treating a threshold count as a cause.

**First saved drive, 2026-09-10:** [one owner-reported jump matches one detected
landing](archive/reviews/2026-09-10-first-jump-capture.md). All 8,974 motion rows are
available/aligned with no detected discontinuities. KI-31's one-unit conversion
difference is now reproduced with actual Mono and reconciled in strict replay;
the unchanged recording is in `results/regression-corpus/index.json`. No new
effect or retune has shipped. [Runtime evidence](archive/reviews/2026-09-11-bug-follow-up.md).

Probe 0.2.5.3 records `forceQuantization`: `truncate-f64-product@1` for the
observed Mono expression, `truncate-f32-product@1` for single-rounded products.
Replay checks the native integer exactly against the recorded output using this
contract; offline force arithmetic keeps its existing 1e-6 tolerance. Before/after
toolkit integer output remains exact on the offline runtime. Unknown contracts
fail; schema-1/2/3 remain readable, with an explicit legacy rule for the verified
Windows Unity 2019.4.38f1 runtime. `runtimeRoundingDifferences` is reported separately.

`Test-Rc.ps1` now runs isolated actual-Mono precision/IPC teardown tests through
`Run-UnityMono.py`. Its child process has a 30-second deadline, so a native wait
regression cannot stall the release gate forever. This does not emulate Unity.

## Recorded contract

Keep `manifest.xml`, `frames.csv`, `forces.csv`, `signals.csv` and (schema 4)
`collisions.csv` together.
The receipt hashes every CSV and identifies the game, mod, recorder and toolkit.
Schema 3 keeps schema 2's stateful force rows, adding exactly one signal row per
force row with the same zero-based index, realtime timestamp and reset epoch.
Sampling uses fixed-capacity value buffers: 250,000 frame observations and 90,000
force/motion observations by default. Overflow marks the saved capture incomplete.
Start allocates memory; Stop writes files only after pausing (or after output
release on shutdown). Capture exceptions stop sampling and preserve incomplete
buffers for an explicit save/retry. The game's menu Quit kills its own process,
bypassing Unity callbacks; probe 0.2.5.2 intercepts that path to release/save first,
with attended quit-save validation pending. Pause, Stop and verify saved files
before quitting. A crash/forced termination can lose unsaved buffers.

| Fields | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `time_s` | Unity realtime clock, copied from the corresponding force observation |
| `physics_time_s` | Unity fixed-time clock for motion differentiation; seconds |
| `valid` | 1 means all four wheels and the Rigidbody were available; 0 means unavailable, with zero placeholders, not measured zero motion |
| `contact_mask` | Downward wheel contact bits: FL=1, FR=2, RL=4, RR=8 |
| `p*_m`, `v*_mps` | Rigidbody world position in meters and velocity in meters/second |
| `qx,qy,qz,qw` | Rigidbody rotation from vehicle-local to world coordinates |
| `local_v*_mps` | Fresh world velocity projected through inverse rotation; local X right, Y up, Z forward |
| `compression_*_m`, `travel_*_m` | Raw wheel compression and available suspension travel in meters, ordered FL/FR/RL/RR; normalized compression is their ratio when capacity is positive |

The probe reads at the boundary where the mod's `CarDynamics.FixedUpdate`
postfix consumes steering force. It reads every value anew; it does not reuse
previous measurements when a component is missing. Unity's ordering of other
components' wheel/Rigidbody updates is not fully established. The first real
trace has coherent advancing physics times and a rear-contact/front-contact
transition one sample apart; that does not prove every component's update order.
Contact is a raycast boolean, not a collision impulse. Compression can exceed
nominal travel; the research file preserves it instead of clipping the evidence.
Frame input channels are the mod's direct-input values, not physical wheel
position/velocity telemetry or all of Rewired's game inputs.

## Standalone analysis

```powershell
dotnet run --project tools/testing/Replay -c Release -- --replay 'C:/path/to/capture'
```

The JSON result retains original-versus-toolkit force comparison, integer device
magnitude checks, reset-history validation and frame timing. Its `signals` section
adds the following descriptive measurements:

- **Landing candidates:** at least 80 ms of observed all-wheel airborne state,
  followed by at least 40 ms of nonzero contact. This rejects brief contact
  flicker. Each candidate references the first contact's force row, prior/current
  steering output, slip, speed, normalized compression and local acceleration.
- **Slide-recovery candidates:** while in contact above 12 km/h, mean front slip
  decreases from at least twice the ideal angle to at most the ideal angle.
  This does not establish oversteer, a tank-slapper, or a driver's wheel motion.
- **Road context:** RMS change in normalized compression across consecutive
  all-four-grounded samples, plus the number of contributing wheel pairs. This
  depends on sample rate and is not road roughness in physical units.
- Maximum absolute local vertical acceleration, usable/missing row counts,
  discontinuities and omitted event count. At most 128 detailed events are
  returned; totals still cover the capture. Missing acceleration reports null.

Acceleration differentiates **world** velocity before projecting into the
current orientation. No derivative or event history crosses a force reset epoch,
missing sample, duplicate/backward physics time, gap above 100 ms or apparent
teleport (displacement above 5 m plus the larger observed speed times delta).
These are conservative research thresholds, not production effect defaults.
Acceleration includes game motion/gravity; it is not a calibrated landing impulse.
Neither landing nor slide candidates classify a crash or prescribe gain/damping.

Schemas 1–3 remain readable, explicitly reporting unavailable newer observations.
Only continuous game-origin schema 2/3/4 captures can enter a regression corpus;
promotion preserves and rechecks all files declared by the schema. Hashes, row counts,
alignment, finite values, contact flags, quaternion and local projection are
validated before a successful report. Signal files are limited to 64 MiB; world
positions above 10 million meters or velocities above 10,000 m/s are rejected as
outside this capture contract. Synthetic test fixtures never qualify as driving
evidence merely because they exercise the game-origin protocol.

## Body collisions — schema 4

`collisions.csv` is an event stream of active-player collision entries, separate
from the wheel-contact flags. It records realtime/physics time, reset epoch,
preceding force row (-1 if none), body/counterpart instance IDs, layer and
road/crowd flags. IDs are process-local integers, not persistent object names.
World relative velocity and body velocity use m/s; total impulse uses N·s;
mass uses kg; position/contact point use meters. The quaternion maps car-local
to world coordinates; normals are unit world vectors. Impulse/mass is a diagnostic
delta-velocity magnitude, not measured steering torque or a wheel gain.

The passive prefix reads the collision before game handling can end the stage.
It checks current player identity, driving and restart state without constructing
an event manager. Collision entries can be observed even if FFB is unavailable;
a force-empty capture remains diagnostic evidence and cannot enter the steering
regression corpus. No `OnCollisionStay` events or timestamps synthesized from
velocity spikes are included.

At most eight contacts are examined per entry; the strongest absolute
normal-relative-speed contact is retained. `contacts`, `examined` and `selected`
make this limit explicit. No contacts means selected=-1 and zero normal/point,
with derived normal speed reported unavailable. The 4,096-entry buffer is
allocated at Start; overflow marks the capture incomplete. Stop hashes/saves the
new file and replay rejects missing/tampered/invalid data. Live collision events
still need verification; actual Mono hook attachment and offline tests pass.

## Next attended capture

The owner's first crash baseline has 2,947 verified force/motion rows, multiple
sharp decelerations and no body-collision callbacks (old probe 0.2.5.3).
[Analysis and next capture](archive/reviews/2026-09-15-crash-capture.md).

Keep the existing force tune. Capture ordinary road, a jump/landing and a
controlled slide, noting car/stage and approximate event times. Compare those
notes/video with candidate rows and signal freshness before choosing an effect
design. Remove the probe and repeat a short run to assess its own overhead.
New impact/damper effects and FR-2 tuning still require this evidence and an
attended hardware comparison. See [the prior signal research](research/2026-09-08-wheel-signals.md).
