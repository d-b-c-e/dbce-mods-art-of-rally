# Overnight investigation and implementation queue

**Post-release triage, 2026-09-27:** 0.2.6 is published and installed. The
GitHub audit found one open issue, [#1 camera view reversal](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/art-of-sim-rally/issues/1),
with no new comment since the reporter said unplugging a PS5 controller resolved
their symptom on 2026-09-06. Queue a paired controller-attached/absent camera
check and ask for fresh 0.2.6 evidence if the reporter sees it again. Do not
close #1 from that one workaround alone. Next local investigations are KI-41's
rendered FFB choice layout, KI-39/40's wider settings/input matrix, KI-38's
constant crash feel, and cold/restart Haapajarvi hitch and landing timing
(KI-5/KI-36/37). The final artifact has not been driven; do not turn the pending
manual checklist into passed evidence. See the [release record](archive/reviews/2026-09-27-release-0.2.6.md).

**Historical queue through 2026-09-19 UTC.** The owner later accepted RC16
overall and requested 0.2.6 publication. Use the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md),
[known issues](KNOWN-ISSUES.md) and [local deployment](LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md) for
current status. Dated entries below preserve earlier states, including the
accepted wheel landing/30 Hz SimHub comparison and rejected helper.

## Current follow-through — crash candidate and 0.2.5 feedback

Owner's RC3 test found no distinct crash effect despite 13 accepted cues (KI-38).
The subsequent shaped RC4 test also failed: three full-intensity cues with no
early managed cancellation, but no felt effect; ordinary steering worked.
The completed standalone comparison favored the constant pulse (A) at 40%,
though still too weak. Owner requested default50/range0–100 and contribution
of findings to the shared toolkit. RC6 introduced a finite constant
crash pulse while preserving landing5/0–40 and one active impact. Playback timing
and stop reasons remain observable. All 16 local gates pass; upstream API/tests
and findings are pushed at `358add5`. Stronger feel is still unaccepted. See the latest
[gate/install receipt](LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md) and [candidate review](archive/reviews/2026-09-17-constant-crash.md).
Next, run the
[front/side/off-on comparison](CRASH-EFFECTS.md). Schema-4 live collision geometry
and SimHub input/output comparison remain pending; no motion gain change.

UX follow-through, 2026-09-19: the coordinator-requested UX-1 Simple/Advanced
work is integrated on main and installed as RC9 with all 16 local gates passed; runtime smoke subsequently failed KI-40.
See its [inventory, evidence and remaining gaps](UX-OVERNIGHT-2026-09-16.md).
The 2026-09-19 deployment includes a verified RC6 backup; exact owner settings,
probe and toolkit358add5 stay intact. Attended
UI/device checks and stronger crash acceptance remain open; no unattended
physical tests or public release.

Reporter confirms good steering and working handbrake on 0.2.5. Request the
Haapajarvi support file and short landing clip for KI-5/KI-36. Investigate
first-contact versus suspension-load timing before changing landing delay or
changing the detector. Owner authorized stronger wheel effects separately:
RC3 extended both impact sliders to 40%, preserving existing peak output
and default 5. Compare 20/30/40 as appropriate for the wheel; stronger-range
acceptance remains pending. Reply is drafted in USER-FEEDBACK; nothing sent.
Owner subsequently tabled motion-telemetry boosting: finish the wheel range and
wait for feedback. Do not add a motion multiplier or tune rig gains in this change.

Investigation now confirms default native per-force disk writes (KI-37), removed
in the local toolkit candidate. Frame counters now detect smaller intervals and
separate the first five seconds; one last landing's contact/compression timing is
available in support. Both owner captures replay, with no first-five-second hitch
and unchanged landing detection. Next: cold/restart Haapajarvi comparison, reporter
file/video, and wheel smoke on the candidate. Public toolkit repin and attended
checks remain prerequisites to publication. See the
[evidence and test sequence](archive/reviews/2026-09-16-landing-startup-investigation.md).

## Crash feedback follow-through — 2026-09-14

2026-09-15 update: first owner crash baseline is preserved in the corpus. New
probe 0.2.5.4 implements bounded body-collision capture with strict schema-4
replay/promotion. Fixed false post-reset landing analysis (KI-34) and existing
corpus append failure (KI-35). Next is the probe's live collision check, then
shared periodic ownership and the independent wheel effect. No motion gain
change is justified by the captured acceleration spikes. See
[the follow-through](archive/reviews/2026-09-15-crash-capture.md).

FR-2 now explicitly includes wheel crash vibration and SimHub motion. Source
investigation and 48 synthetic crash scenarios are complete; see the
[crash study](research/2026-09-14-crash-feedback.md). Queue the separate probe's
collision observations and a labelled front/side-impact drive before choosing
thresholds. Coordinate periodic-effect ownership before adding crash output:
the landing adapter currently releases all periodic slots. Compare SimHub raw
inputs with effect/platform output before retuning motion. No crash feature is
installed and no new hardware result is claimed.

## Landing follow-through — 2026-09-12

Owner requested implementing/testing FR-2's landing feedback. The consumer
detector, independent strength UI and finite native-burst integration are ready
for combined validation. The unchanged real drive yields one event at first
rear contact. Shared native finite duration/focus/watchdog fixes belong to the
toolkit's local 0.13.0 candidate, not a published toolkit release. No nonzero
effect has been physically evaluated. Follow [LANDING-EFFECTS.md](LANDING-EFFECTS.md)
for off/on testing; retain FFB startup, gauges, quit and other RC checks.

## Support follow-through — 2026-09-12

T300/TSS setup questions have a code-checked unsent reply in USER-FEEDBACK.
KI-32's font scaling defect is corrected in locally installed RC7, with clearer
handbrake/logging/smoothing help. All 16 local gates including the drive corpus
pass; normal/enlarged UMM font display needs a visual check. Existing launch/FFB,
gauge clearing and quit checks below remain pending. Stable remains 0.2.4.

## Follow-through — 2026-09-11 UTC

KI-28 focused-window idle recovery and production menu-Quit output release are
implemented. Probe 0.2.5.3 fixes an isolated-Mono shutdown hang (KI-30). KI-31 is
reconciled with actual Mono; the first unchanged real drive now passes the corpus
gate. Local DSS speed/RPM bindings have an explicit stopped-game zero fallback;
SimHub reloaded both displays; physical retest remains pending. RC6 and probe
0.2.5.3 are installed after all 16 local gates including the real corpus. The landing study
finds a 5 ms pulse peak undersampled at roughly 60 Hz; no new effect is shipped.
See [the complete handoff](archive/reviews/2026-09-11-bug-follow-up.md).

Next: new-candidate attended launch/FFB, finish gauges, menu/Alt+F4 quit and
probe-off comparison; then a sample-rate-aware landing-effect design upstream.
GitHub still has issue #1 only, with a reporter workaround and no maintainer
acknowledgment. Draft saved in USER-FEEDBACK; nothing posted. Earlier queue below
records the investigation as it was opened.

## Next RC blockers — owner follow-up 2026-09-10

1. KI-28: FFB failed at startup before probe load; invalid-window/exclusive
   acquisition failure remained unavailable. Validate focused game window and
   bounded idle retry, preserving strict identity and releasing input readers.
2. KI-29: finish/exit gauges stayed at speed despite SimHub recognising race end.
   Reproduce consumer zeroing and capture the final UDP sequence before changing it.
3. KI-30: investigate Alt+F4 hang with probe, especially IPC thread teardown;
   compare probe absent/present. Successful save does not establish clean exit.
4. Reconcile KI-31's one-unit Mono/offline integer conversion mismatch without
   weakening evidence checks, then promote the first saved drive to the corpus.
   One jump now has clear contact/compression/motion evidence; see
   [the analysis](archive/reviews/2026-09-10-first-jump-capture.md). Prototype impact
   envelopes offline before considering new hardware effects. KI-27's distinct
   menu-kill save hook still needs its own attended test.

RC5's FFB and telemetry attended cases are failed. These items take priority over
new effects. Nothing is recording; no automatic game relaunch or publication.

**2026-09-10 attended update:** RC5's first jump drive retained performance and
FFB logs (12,206 measured driving intervals; maximum 34 ms; zero 100 ms+ hitches),
but normal menu Quit killed the unsaved capture (KI-27). Probe 0.2.5.2 adds a
pre-quit save hook after the KI-26 Mono IPC fix. Explicit saving works in Unity;
the second attempt was abandoned (zero force rows) and excluded from the corpus.
Nothing is recording. A later retry now has a verified saved capture with one
landing; it is diagnostic-only pending KI-31's replay reconciliation.
[Current attended session](archive/reviews/2026-09-10-attended-rc5.md).

**Latest status (2026-09-09 UTC): all four post-0.2.4 queue items implemented
with offline coverage, plus a telemetry lifecycle follow-up.** Published stable
remains 0.2.4; a local 0.2.5 candidate is installed. See
[the overnight handoff](archive/reviews/2026-09-09-overnight-025.md) and
[deployment receipt](LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md). Next: candidate drive, TSS/Fanatec,
camera/motion checks and first real signal capture. No new hardware sign-off.
Earlier release/RC entries below are historical.

## Completed overnight queue — after 0.2.4

Prepared and executed at the owner's request. Four original work items are
complete offline; none implies a successful game playthrough or new force tune.

| Order | Work | Result / remaining acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | USB identity/reconnect | KI-21 strict GUID channel bindings, unique legacy migration, neutral missing devices and idle recovery. KI-23 extends strict selection/display to shifters. Combined input/shifter suite: 157 assertions. TSS/Fanatec/USB hardware checks pending. |
| 2 | Last-session stutter diagnostics | Bounded opt-in snapshots at idle/normal exit, build/timestamps and distinct session labels; 51 support assertions including locked files, stale/corrupt data and allocation checks. Real game retention pending. |
| 3 | Lifecycle/performance audit | Reproduced and corrected stale force on missing wheel data (KI-22), stale shifter indices (KI-23), and assignment/edit saves while driving (KI-24). 19 force-lifecycle assertions and 41 watchdog/camera lifecycle assertions. No reported-hitch causation claimed. |
| 4 | Development signal capture | Schema-3 contact/suspension/motion observations, standalone landing/slide/force context; schema-1/2 compatibility, corruption rejection, bounded buffers/events. 42 recorder assertions, 14 actual hook assertions, 31 Python tests. No production recorder/effects or real capture. [Contract](DEVELOPMENT-CAPTURE.md). |
| Follow-up | Telemetry connection/disable lifecycle | KI-25 reproduced socket creation during driving. Setup now runs idle after force release; driving edits wait for pause, disabling parks immediately. 74 actual game-field/loopback assertions. Live consumers pending. |

**Further roadmap audit:** no new GitHub reports. Remaining force effects,
RWD snapback and T300 rotation work needs the first real capture or reporter
hardware A/B. Generic calibration abstractions and full Unity input playback need
separate designs. A bounded telemetry-send worker is a future investigation:
the current sender is synchronous, but no send stall was measured here. Preserve
latest-frame/drop/park/shutdown semantics before adopting one.

**Requires a person or reporter:** the installed 0.2.5-rc.5 drive; full camera/input/FFB
matrix; Nexus CameraMod screen checks; TSS/Fanatec behavior; T300 rotation A/B;
motion/shaker comparison; first real capture. These can be prepared overnight but
must not be marked passed from offline work. Do not change physics, assists or
physical wheel rotation based on an unconfirmed report.

**GitHub refresh:** still one open issue (#1), one existing issue comment, zero PR
review comments and zero commit comments. No new actionable report found; no
messages sent. Use the existing 0.2.4 support draft when the owner wants to reply.

Finish each coherent feature/fix with its relevant tests and documentation, then
run the full local gate for a new immutable candidate (next line: `0.2.5-rc.N`).
Deploy the validated package to the local install as a completion checklist item,
preserving settings and backups. If the game is open, record deployment pending
for the next active session. Scheduled deployment checks are disabled; public
publication remains a separate authorization. Documentation/tooling-only work
that leaves the shipping payload unchanged needs no replacement game install.

## Previous overnight work — historical

Prepared 2026-09-08 UTC after [0.2.3 publication](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/art-of-sim-rally/releases/tag/v0.2.3).
Executed on `codex/overnight-improvements` at the owner's request. The unattended
implementation and research items below are complete; **0.2.4-rc.2 passes all 16
automated checks** and awaits an attended drive. [Exact artifact and handoff](archive/reviews/2026-09-08-overnight.md).
Published 0.2.3 is unchanged. The later owner-requested RC4 install replaces it
locally behind the same Stream Deck target; see the follow-up review below.
The owner requested local deployment when finishing each feature/fix; scheduled
checks are now disabled. See [LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md](LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md).

Read [USER-FEEDBACK.md](USER-FEEDBACK.md), [KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md) and
[RELEASE-READINESS.md](RELEASE-READINESS.md). The full attended matrix is still
pending; 0.2.3-rc.6 owner smoke passed for cameras, stutter and controls only.

Later T300/TSS feedback authorized another implementation pass. See
[the follow-up review](archive/reviews/2026-09-08-feedback-review.md): CameraMod isolation,
support-log/frame-health improvements, clearer assist help, KI-16 telemetry
correction and actual failed-send handling are now implemented beyond RC2.
**0.2.4-rc.4 passes all 16 automated checks** with those changes; its exact
archive, source identity and pending attended checklist are in that review.
The original work-order table below records the first pass. New wheel effects
and T300 rotation changes still require measured signals/hardware evidence.

## Work order

| Order | Priority / item | Status | Completion evidence / remaining work |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | P1 — Camera tuner persistence and log volume, KI-14 | Implemented; offline pass | Actual locked-file reproduction now recovers through watchdog; idle retry, view handback, disable/shutdown and log-volume checks pass |
| 2 | P1 — Camera tuning key remapping, FR-1 | Implemented; UI drive pending | All 11 actions, clear/cancel/defaults, duplicate/modifier validation, XML and panel/capture isolation covered in 182 camera assertions |
| 3 | P1 — TSS handbrake support and input regression, KI-13 | Implemented; TSS pending | 90 input assertions; also reproduced/fixed KI-15 cache, Flip and assignment-read defects. Added live values and confirmed proportional game torque path |
| 4 | P2 — T300 rotation investigation, KI-12 | Static audit and A/B procedure complete | No explicit degrees request in pinned paths; hardware/driver response still unknown; no upstream change justified yet |
| 5 | P2 — Light steering with road/impact feedback, FR-2; RWD snapback, KI-6 | Research and numerical study complete | 10,242 assertions / 4,848 synthetic rows against shared mixer. Headroom retunes steering even without events. New telemetry sampling defects KI-16 need separate follow-up |
| 6 | P2 — GitHub #1 / hardware follow-ups, KI-1/KI-3/KI-5 | Audit refreshed; drafts ready | Still one issue and its existing PS5-unplug comment. No messages sent; reporter/hardware results pending |
| 7 | P1 validation — Real capture and attended checks | Instructions/checklist updated; requires owner | TEST-DRIVE and generated gate include new key/Flip/reconnect cases. No stage driven or real capture obtained overnight |

See [the signal audit](research/2026-09-08-wheel-signals.md) for items 4–5 and
[TEST-DRIVE.md](TEST-DRIVE.md) for the next attended session. The sections below
retain the task rationale and acceptance criteria; statuses above describe the
completed implementation, not a completed hardware sign-off.

## 1. Camera tuner save failures and logging

The 0.2.3 baseline finding in `CameraTuner.Update`: `_dirty` was cleared before calling
`Main.SaveSettings()`, its boolean failure result is ignored, and "saved" is
logged regardless. Its timer only runs while a mounted view is active. Therefore
the new learned-axis save retry does not cover camera tuning; toggling to a stock
view before the timer expires can leave the camera save pending until another
save or mounted-view update. A held adjustment also formats/writes a log per frame.

Reproduce with an actual locked settings file plus controlled timing and camera
ownership transitions. Keep success logs conditional on successful persistence,
retry idle failures at a bounded rate, and flush/retry through a lifecycle path
that survives leaving the mounted view. Release outputs before shutdown disk IO.
Avoid making every frame a disk-write/log path. Do not claim this explains the
old stage-start stutter: it is a separate path that requires camera adjustments.

Relevant: `CameraTuner.cs`, `Main.SaveSettings`, `DeferredSave.cs`,
`ModWatchdog.cs`, `SettingsPersistence.cs`; regression and lifecycle harnesses.

## 2. Camera keys without a numpad

Use the existing `Settings.Key*` fields rather than inventing a second persisted
mapping format. Expose keyboard rebind, cancellation, clearing where appropriate
and reset-to-defaults; show the current mapping in help. Suppress tuner actions
while listening for a binding or editing the panel. Handle duplicate tuning keys
explicitly and explain possible overlap with game actions: raw Unity input does
not prevent a key from also reaching Rewired. The current source comment claiming
it cannot collide is incorrect.

Make settings accessible with either bonnet or bumper enabled; today the tuning
toggle is nested only beneath the bonnet option. Preserve numpad defaults and
existing XML mappings. Tests should cover cancellation, duplicate handling,
modifier/key validation, persistence, and bumper-only configuration. Actual UMM
key capture, stock-view isolation and another camera mod need screen tests.

## 3. TSS handbrake

The support steps are in TROUBLESHOOTING.md and the unsent draft in USER-FEEDBACK.md.
Current `WheelInput.Update` normalizes non-steering axes to 0..1;
`WheelInputPatch.Override` writes that float to `handbrakeInput` only when bound.
Unbound steering/pedals retain game input. Inspect the remaining game input-to-
brake path only as needed; no grip, braking or assist modifications.

Add integration coverage for partial pulls, reversed axes, zero span, disconnected
device and preservation of unbound channels. A TSS owner must confirm raw and
normalized rest/25%/50%/100% and release, plus gameplay behavior. Do not treat a
different handbrake or synthetic input as a TSS hardware pass.

## 4. Rotation readout

The pinned toolkit's `WheelFfb.cpp` writes `DIPROP_RANGE` 0..65535 for input
normalization and changes autocenter. The initial audit found no physical
degrees-setting call. This does not exclude a driver/profile response to acquiring
FFB. Do not convert the logical range into degrees or blame the toolkit from the
control-panel screenshot alone.

Next: trace FFB initialization/read-only opens and available driver diagnostics,
then prepare an attended baseline with the same driver profile: vanilla, mod with
FFB disabled, mod FFB enabled, direct input separately toggled. Keep third-party
camera mods/pad/virtual-controller state explicit. Record control-panel setting,
measured physical travel and normalized game steering independently. If a toolkit
call is causal, produce a minimal repro upstream, release there and repin here.

## 5. Effect separation and snapback

Current production uses `AxleForceCurve@1` through constant `SetForce`; it has no
dedicated road, crash or landing rumble path. Identify contact transitions, vertical
acceleration and collision signals without changing physics. Compare available
toolkit condition/periodic/event primitives before duplicating them locally.

Separate steering gain from event gain, bound impulses independently of the
low-speed fade (KNOWN-ISSUES U-3), and reset every effect on pause/focus/disable/
shutdown. RWD snapback needs a capture with speed, slip, force history and wheel
motion before choosing damping or more smoothing. More smoothing can add delay;
do not assume it fixes snapback. Keep shipping defaults identical until an attended
tuning comparison supports a change. Offline experiments must never send force.

## 6–7. Human and external follow-up

GitHub audit found only #1 and its existing PS5-unplug comment. Drafts are ready
in USER-FEEDBACK.md; no messages were sent or issue state changed. A future session
can refresh the read-only audit, but should not post drafts without authorization.

RC4 is now installed behind the existing Stream Deck Steam 550320 key at the
owner's request; the previous stable install was backed up.
The developer probe was removed for the shipping setup. Install it separately
only for the capture portion of [TEST-DRIVE.md](TEST-DRIVE.md), pause before
Start/Stop, then remove it again for final runtime checks. Preserve each completed
capture and use `-Corpus` on subsequent RC runs; generated fixtures remain synthetic.
Do not attempt automated game keyboard injection or present arithmetic replay as
Unity playthrough replay.

## End-of-session handoff

Commit each coherent change with its tests; update this queue, KNOWN-ISSUES,
CHANGELOG Unreleased and `.Codex/session-notes.md`. Run a warnings-as-errors build
and meaningful affected suites. Any new candidate uses a new version/RC number;
do not overwrite 0.2.3 or RC6. Record what passed offline, what is only source
evidence and what requires an attended check. Publishing another release and
changing hardware force behavior are not implied by preparing this queue.
