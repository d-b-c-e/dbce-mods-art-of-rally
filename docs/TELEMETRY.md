# Telemetry

For setup, start with [SimHub and ButtKicker](SETUP.md#simhub-and-buttkicker).
This reference describes packet contents, units and developer checks.

## Why Forza's format

art of rally has no telemetry output. Rather than invent a format and then
write plugins for every consumer, the mod emits the **Forza Horizon 4/5 "Data
Out"** UDP packet, which SimHub, dashboards, motion rigs, wind simulators and
bass shakers already understand.

That is the entire reuse argument: pick a format the ecosystem already speaks,
and art of rally inherits the ecosystem for free with nobody writing a plugin.

## The packet

324 bytes, little-endian, one datagram per physics frame, UDP to
`127.0.0.1:8000` by default (SimHub's default Forza port).

The layout is the Forza Motorsport 7 "sled" (232 bytes), then a **12-byte block
the Horizon titles insert**, then the "dash" fields. That insert is why FM7's
311-byte dash offsets do not work here and why the packet is 324 rather than
311 bytes. Getting this wrong does not throw — it renders a plausible,
completely incorrect dashboard.

### Field map

| **232** | — | **12-byte Horizon insert, left zero** |
| 244 | f32 ×3 | `Position` X/Y/Z |
| **256** | f32 | **`Speed` (m/s) — anchor offset** |
| 260 / 264 | f32 | `Power` (W), `Torque` (Nm) |
| 268 | f32 ×4 | `TireTemp` |
| 284 / 288 / 292 | f32 | `Boost`, `Fuel`, `DistanceTraveled` |
| 296–308 | f32 | `BestLap`, `LastLap`, `CurrentLap`, `CurrentRaceTime` |
| 312 | u16 | `LapNumber` |
| 314 | u8 | `RacePosition` |
| 315–318 | u8 | `Accel`, `Brake`, `Clutch`, `HandBrake` |
| **319** | u8 | **`Gear` — anchor offset** |
| 320–322 | s8 | `Steer`, `NormalizedDrivingLine`, `NormalizedAIBrakeDifference` |
| 323 | u8 | unused by Forza — we stamp `'R'` (0x52) as a source sentinel |

Wheel arrays are **always** front-left, front-right, rear-left, rear-right.
`WheelValues` names the corners rather than using a `float[4]` precisely so this
cannot be got wrong silently.

`WheelOnRumbleStrip` is `s32` while every array around it is `f32`. Writing a
float there yields `1.0f == 0x3F800000`, which a consumer reads as
`1065353216`. There is a regression test for this.

### Where the offsets come from

`Speed` at 256 and `Gear` at 319 are the two anchors that pin the whole layout,
and they are **not** guesses. They are taken from the sibling
`cruisn-collection` project's `harness/forza_synth.py` and `forza_probe.py`,
which were validated live against SimHub's Forza Horizon profile. Everything
else follows from field order and sizes, and the arithmetic closes exactly:
sled ends at 232, dash starts at 244, packet ends at 324.

The toolkit's `Dbce.Wheel.Telemetry.Tests` locks all of this down. If a change breaks
`SpeedIsAtOffset256_TheAnchorForTheHorizonLayout`, the change is wrong.

## Mapping art of rally onto it

The mod fills a neutral `TelemetryFrame` (metres, m/s, radians, watts, newton-
metres) and `ForzaPacket` encodes it. Sources, from
[FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md):

| Forza field | art of rally source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `IsRaceOn` | driving **or held on the start line** | true from `WAITING_TO_BEGIN` so a shaker follows the engine while revving before the lights; must go false in menus and cutscenes, or dashboards never park |
| `CurrentEngineRpm` | `Drivetrain` RPM | |
| `EngineMaxRpm` / `EngineIdleRpm` | `Drivetrain.maxRPM` / `.minRPM` | |
| `Speed` | `CarDynamics.velo` × 0.6 | m/s as the HUD shows it. `HudManager.HandleSpeedometer` displays `drivetrain.velo` (the same forward body speed) × 2.237 (mph) or 3.6 (km/h) × 0.6; dashboards apply their own unit, so both match. The HUD's other type, wheel speed, is a private unset field that this build never selects |
| `Velocity` X/Y/Z | Rigidbody world velocity projected by inverse car rotation | vehicle-local m/s; corrected in 0.2.4 |
| `AngularVelocity` | Rigidbody world angular velocity projected by inverse car rotation | vehicle-local rad/s; corrected in 0.2.4 |
| `Acceleration` | differentiate world velocity, then inverse-rotate | local m/s²; reset on discontinuity, not stored by the game |
| `Yaw`/`Pitch`/`Roll` | `myTransform.rotation` | convert to radians |
| `TireSlipRatio` | `Wheel.slipRatio` | |
| `TireSlipAngle` | `Wheel.slipAngle` | |
| `TireCombinedSlip` | derive from the two above | |
| `SuspensionTravelMeters` | `Wheel.compression` | bounded by available travel; corrected in 0.2.4 |
| `NormalizedSuspensionTravel` | `compression / suspensionTravel` | clamp 0..1; zero for invalid/zero capacity |
| `SurfaceRumble` | `Wheel.surfaceType` / `physicMaterial` | the field bass shakers key off |
| `WheelInPuddleDepth` | `Wheel.isOnPuddle` | |
| `TireTemp` | not modelled | leave zero |
| `Power` / `Torque` | torque × RPM × π/30; `Drivetrain.torque` | watts, Nm |
| `Gear` | `Drivetrain.gear` against the car's `neutral` index, as the HUD's `RPMDisplay` shows it | 0 = reverse (R), neutral = 11 (SimHub decodes 11 as N), otherwise `gear - neutral` capped at 10 |
| `Accel`/`Brake`/`Clutch`/`HandBrake` | `CarController.*Input` | via `TelemetryFrame.ToPedal` |
| `Steer` | `CarController.steerInput` | via `TelemetryFrame.ToSteer` |
| `DrivetrainType` | fixed 2 placeholder | not a measured drivetrain classification |
| `CurrentRaceTime` / `CurrentLap` | `Time.timeSinceLevelLoad` | scene time, not an authoritative race timer |
| `RacePosition`, `LapNumber` | 1 | no wheel-to-wheel racing |

0.2.4 corrects sampling units/axes (KI-16), leaving the toolkit packet layout
unchanged. A half-compressed 0.20 m suspension now reports 0.10 m / 0.50 normalized
instead of 0.20 m / 0.10. This changes shaker/motion response and needs an attended
consumer comparison before release. Telemetry does not add wheel FFB effects.
Acceleration is zero on the first sample after spawn/park/restart, invalid motion,
clock rollback/gaps over 250 ms, or a position jump over 5 m beyond predicted
displacement. These guards are for telemetry differentiation; they do not change
the game car. Tire-slip semantics and the placeholder fields above are not
calibrated impact-force signals.

Use `ToPedal` and `ToSteer` rather than casting. The game's smoothed inputs
overshoot their nominal 0..1 range, and an unchecked cast of `1.01f` wraps to
near zero — a full-throttle reading that momentarily shows as idle.

## Testing without the game

Two independent halves, so a failure can always be localised.

**Prove the consumer** — emit a known-good synthetic drive with no game running:

```powershell
python <toolkit>/tools/forza/forza_synth.py           # port 8000
python <toolkit>/tools/forza/forza_synth.py 5300
```

Speed ramps 0→130→0 mph on a 20 s triangle, gears step 1–5, RPM sawtooths per
gear, steering oscillates. If SimHub mirrors that, the layout and the consumer
are both fine. The synth uses the real `ForzaPacket` encoder, so it cannot drift
from what the mod actually sends.

**Prove the emitter** — listen and print, with SimHub closed:

```bash
python <toolkit>/tools/forza/forza_probe.py    # port 8000
```

The `src` column reads `mod` when byte 323 carries our sentinel, so packets from
this project are distinguishable from anything else on the port. Every packet is
logged to `results/forza_probe_log.csv`.

Verified 2026-08-31: synth → probe round-trips correctly across the C#/Python
boundary, 178 packets, zero failures, all fields decoding to the sent values.

If the probe is right and SimHub is wrong, the problem is the SimHub game
profile, not the emitter.

## Consumer setup

**No SimHub helper/plugin is required.** The withdrawn RC9 companion has been
removed. Existing **Impacts** and **Road impacts** use velocity and suspension
data already exported by the mod. Tune their frequency/response in SimHub;
wheel landing strength does not control the ButtKicker. The local built-in
30 Hz comparison profile preserves original gains. See the
[findings and A/B procedure](reviews/2026-09-12-builtin-shaker-correction.md).

In 0.2.5, enable telemetry and configure its destination while
paused or in a menu. The idle watchdog opens the connection after releasing
force. If edited during driving, the working destination remains active until
pause applies the change; the panel shows the actual endpoint and pending state.
Turning telemetry off parks/closes the socket on the next watchdog tick even if
driving continues. Packet encoding and sampling are unchanged. UDP delivery and
synchronous send duration are still outside the mod's guarantees; KI-25 covers
connection placement, not a measured explanation for game stutter.

SimHub: add a game profile using **Forza Horizon 5** / Forza Data Out and point
it at UDP 8000. Any consumer that accepts the 324-byte Horizon packet works
unchanged.
