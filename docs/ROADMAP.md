# Roadmap

Status reviewed 2026-09-30 after the 0.2.7 stable release. Official toolkit
v0.15.0, the final local gate, installation and published-download verification
are complete. The final package has not been driven, and the full attended
matrix remains open. See [release review](archive/reviews/2026-09-30-release-0.2.7.md),
[0.2.7 release notes](releases/0.2.7.md)
and [installed identity](LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md).
The defect register is [KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md); the implementation review
is [2026-09-06-rc-review.md](archive/reviews/2026-09-06-rc-review.md).

## Released feature — landing vibration

A finite hardware sine burst now has its own strength control, separate
from steering Strength/Smoothing. The game detector reproduces the one landing
in the saved Norway drive and rejects jitter/reset cases offline. Toolkit
finite-burst work is officially published and pinned as v0.13.0, with identical
binaries to the tested RC8. Owner wheel feedback is accepted;
the full hardware matrix remains incomplete.
See [implementation, limits and A/B drive](LANDING-EFFECTS.md).

Remaining feature priorities:

**Binding regression (KI-43):** a T300/TSS user reports that 0.2.6 kept old
bindings but could not capture new ones after the handbrake stopped working.
Version 0.2.7 improves reader preservation/retry and saved-axis calibration;
obtain a failed-state support file and attended TSS retest before claiming the
report fixed. The owner cleared/rebound a MOZA handbrake and reported a
good drive on installed 0.2.7-rc.1; its saved binding is confirmed. Test paused
Bind, full-travel/release/Save, Calibrate, separate USB TSS handbrake and an
existing saved profile. Resolve the ambiguous "not assigned" label report.

**Gear-shift wheel cue (0.2.7 release):** an opt-in 25 Hz/120 ms wheel cue at
gear engagement, initially 5% nominal force with a 0–20% range. It watches only
the active player's drivetrain while driving, focused and outside settings or
restart; neutral transitions are ignored. One existing finite sine slot is
shared with landing, and landing/crash take priority. Offline hook and effect
arbitration tests pass. Real wheel feel and event timing remain to be checked;
see [investigation](research/2026-09-29-crash-shift-feedback.md).

**Settings UX adoption (KI-39/KI-41):** Simple/Advanced pages, transactional
calibration, USB mod/camera buttons, strict FFB follow/override, atomic connection
drafts and support guidance are integrated and installed as RC16. The owner
reported the native game-bindings handoff working and accepted the current build
overall. The complete layout/focus/device matrix across resolutions and hardware
is still open. See the [inventory and test record](UX-OVERNIGHT-2026-09-16.md).

**Current focus: FR-2 crash feedback in wheel FFB and SimHub motion.** The game
has a collision callback suitable for passive observation; 48 new synthetic
crash scenarios pass through the production telemetry sampler and encoded UDP.
The owner crash drive is preserved and replays exactly: a roughly 145→4 km/h
head-on event produces almost zero steering output. Probe 0.2.5.4 now adds body
collision observations; its live drive check is pending. Version 0.2.6
implements an independent opt-in wheel crash effect and shared landing/crash
impact ownership. [Candidate and test plan](CRASH-EFFECTS.md).
RC3 passed all 16 local gates but its owner drive produced no distinct crash cue
despite 13 accepted commands (KI-38). RC4 replaced the rapid sine
with a kick/fading rebound at the same peak, plus playback timing diagnostics.
That RC4 retest also failed: three shape-accepted cues, zero early managed stops,
no felt kick, normal steering intact. In the standalone comparison, only the
constant pulse was noticeable at 20%; the owner preferred it at 40% but wanted
more strength. Installed RC6 uses a finite constant crash pulse,
new-settings default50/range0–100; landing stays default5/range0–40. API status
does not prove physical output, and the stronger range remains unaccepted.
Findings and the generic finite constant API are contributed upstream for other
consumers; their tunes are not automatically changed.
All 16 RC16 local gates pass, including both recorded corpus cases; saved owner
strengths are preserved. The owner requested 0.2.6 publication while stronger
crash-specific physical acceptance remains open.
The subsequent 0.2.7-rc.1 drive log contains a full-intensity head-on command,
but the saved crash slider was still 19.52381%; its submitted magnitude was
0.1952. Compare the unchanged crash cue at 50% before retuning it.
See [implementation and evidence](archive/reviews/2026-09-17-constant-crash.md) and the latest
[gate/install receipt](LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md). Next: retest crash feel and ordinary
landing/steering/lifecycle behavior. The consumer now pins official toolkit
v0.15.0 with binary-identical payloads. SimHub motion
amplification remains explicitly deferred. See
[findings and validation sequence](research/2026-09-14-crash-feedback.md) and
[drive evidence](archive/reviews/2026-09-15-crash-capture.md).

1. **RWD snapback/tankslap investigation (KI-6):** capture steering/slip recovery
   before deciding whether an optional damper is justified.
2. **ButtKicker landing thud and independent road/crash effects (FR-2):** owner
   says wheel FFB is fine; the desired hard landing impact is on the shaker.
   RC9's extra SimHub helper was rejected and removed. Use built-in Impacts/Road
   impacts with existing velocity/suspension telemetry. The owner accepted the
   30 Hz comparison and observed amplifier clipping; no further gain increase.
   Road texture and collisions need their own reliable signals and tuning.
3. **TSS/Fanatec follow-up and T300 rotation:** verify actual devices and modes;
   use reports to improve setup guidance and eventually per-wheel starting settings.
4. **Camera compatibility:** PS5-controller interaction in issue #1 and the
   separate Nexus camera-mod combination still need scoped testing.
5. **Performance:** diagnose reported hitches with evidence; move UDP sending to
   a bounded worker only if measurement justifies that transport change.
   New 0.2.5 Haapajarvi first-five-second report awaits its support file (KI-5).
   Local candidate removes per-update native force logging by default (KI-37);
   finer frame counters and landing timing diagnostics are implemented. Verify
   cold/restart behavior before claiming the reported hitch fixed.
6. **Distribution/tooling:** Nexus packaging and richer regression captures;
   full deterministic Unity input playback remains a separate design effort.

Already implemented: camera-key remapping, direct analog handbrake input,
strict USB identity/recovery, diagnostics, lifecycle fixes and font scaling.
These are validation/support work rather than missing features.

**Landing timing/strength:** investigate the Haapajarvi slightly-early report
(KI-36) before changing first-contact timing. The requested optional 30–40 wheel
strength is implemented for 0.2.6: landing allows 0–40% with default 5;
the experimental crash kick allows 0–100% with default 50. Existing values are
preserved. Physical comparison of the
stronger range remains pending. The owner's ButtKicker clipping is a separate
device/output observation and does not establish another rig's wheel limit.
Owner clarified motion-rig telemetry was the primary interest, then explicitly
tabled telemetry boosting on 2026-09-16: put the wheel range through testing
first and wait for feedback. Keep motion telemetry/profile gains unchanged.
Physics contact, rendered wheel position and the stock game's all-wheel cue are
different signals; the saved jump's 16.67 ms gap is a lead, not an automatic delay.
See [investigation](archive/reviews/2026-09-16-landing-startup-investigation.md).

The four post-0.2.4 [overnight items](OVERNIGHT-QUEUE.md) are implemented with
offline coverage: USB identity/idle recovery, retained diagnostic summaries,
reproduced lifecycle fixes, and separate development signal captures. Additional
telemetry connection/disable work (KI-25) follows that audit. Manual hardware
checks remain required. The first real jump capture now passes runtime-aware
replay and is preserved in the regression corpus. FFB startup/exit and probe
shutdown fixes are installed in 0.2.5; local gauge idle bindings were reloaded and
need a physical retest. Landing detection passes 30/60/120 Hz cases; the finite
vibration has owner acceptance, with the full hardware matrix still incomplete.
See [the follow-up](archive/reviews/2026-09-11-bug-follow-up.md). Synchronous UDP send
remains a potential future bounded-worker task, requiring measured need and
careful park/drop/shutdown behavior; it is not a confirmed stutter diagnosis.
[USER-FEEDBACK.md](USER-FEEDBACK.md) records the T300/TSS report, camera-key
remapping request and the post-release GitHub audit with unsent support drafts.
Implemented for the **0.2.4 release**: camera-tuner save retry/logging (KI-14),
keyboard remapping (FR-1), and analog-handbrake regression coverage (KI-13) with
cache/Flip/assignment fixes (KI-15). Camera and input harnesses pass offline;
RC4 was installed and driven; overall feedback was good with a strong stutter.
[KI-20 investigation](archive/reviews/2026-09-09-rc4-stutter.md) corrected a lazy-manager
polling defect in RC5. Its owner retest was accepted and the error flood was absent; full attended checks remain pending. Rotation and effect-signal
investigations are documented in [the signal audit](research/2026-09-08-wheel-signals.md).
The [follow-up implementation](archive/reviews/2026-09-08-feedback-review.md) adds
CameraMod isolation, bounded support logs/frame-hitch counts, clearer assist help,
telemetry sampling correction (KI-16) and actual failed-send handling. These have
offline coverage; motion/shaker and combined-camera-mod tests remain pending.
New FFB effects and RWD damping remain a separate captured-signal/attended tuning
cycle. No rotation override is justified by the current T300 evidence.

## Now — remaining 0.2.5 validation and real signal captures

Owner RC5 testing was accepted for 0.2.4; earlier 0.2.3 RC6 feedback also reported
working cameras and controls. These are scoped results, not a complete matrix. Implemented;
still requiring the complete attended checks:

- Camera child-transform restoration, including explicit replay/cinematic
  handback, mod/feature disable and restoration of a usable stock angle.
- Deferred learned-axis saves, failed-write retry and output release before
  persistence at shutdown. The reported 10–15 second stutter remains unconfirmed.
- Support build identity, observed native module paths/hashes and read-only
  native version diagnostics. A Plugins/x86_64 copy is an intentional install path.
- Version-consistent packages, full payload integrity checks, and settings-preserving
  install/uninstall. The synthetic installer tests do not exercise UMM's GUI.
- Telemetry recovery after a destination failure; loopback regression covers
  reconnect, parking and shutdown. Live consumer testing remains pending.

Development tooling is separate: bounded capture probe, external Start/Stop,
game-free force replay, a saved regression corpus and the release evidence gate.
No recorder ships in the release mod. One completed real jump drive is preserved
and passes strict steering replay; it does not measure the new periodic force.

Run [PRE-RELEASE-TESTING.md](PRE-RELEASE-TESTING.md). The release needs the exact
packaged candidate tested for camera transitions, cold/repeated/new-stage stutter,
FFB lifecycle, binding persistence, telemetry, support identity and the normal UMM
upgrade path. Offline tests are useful evidence, not a replacement for those cases.

Issue #1 is not proven to be the camera code defect: the reporter says removing
a USB PS5 controller resolved it. Their support snapshot also binds ChangeCamera
to `Accelerator -`. Preserve that distinction and test with/without the pad where
available. Fanatec-specific confirmation and RWD wheel snap reports remain open.

## Toolkit adoption: implemented, awaiting attended validation

Earlier 0.2.4/RC7 used **toolkit v0.12.0**, native component **0.5.0**, downloaded from the
[official release](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit/releases/tag/v0.12.0).
Version 0.2.5 uses official toolkit **v0.13.0/native 0.6.0**, published from
`dd0ef20ad0cdaccc7a67f10a707dbd2a27a6efe9`. All five vendored files are identical
to those tested in RC8. Full local package and zero-output R12 ABI checks pass.
Production references and packages `Dbce.Wheel.Ffb.dll`: the shared wrapper handles
loading, enumeration, FFB, shifter and direct-input reads. The native alias remains
`UnityForceFeedback.dll`, bound from one exact module handle.

Shared `AxleForceCurve@1` implements the released gain, fade, clamp, then EMA
pipeline. Local ForceCurve is only a forwarding adapter. The original formula is
frozen in consumer regression with the game's actual managed Mathf. Existing
`simlite@2` remains a different tune; it is not the adopted pipeline. The landing
release adds a periodic effect, default on at strength 5; no damper, assist or physics changes.

New explicit FFB picker choices persist an instance GUID. Missing GUIDs report a
setup error and never select another wheel. Existing name/index settings remain
readable. Reader handles are refreshed when switching FFB devices. Transactional
sync resolves KI-9. Schema-3 captures add contact/suspension/world-local motion
to schema 2's reset boundaries and force-library hash. Replay compares original and toolkit outputs with separate filter histories,
checks device integers and reports frame timing. See [TEST-DRIVE.md](TEST-DRIVE.md).

Next after a tested release: investigate RWD snapback (KI-6), then consider bounded
damper/road/impact effects in a separate tune/test window. Generic calibration
abstractions and deterministic Unity input playback remain future work. Game hooks,
UI, camera and telemetry sampling stay here; native lifecycle, encoder and force
arithmetic belong upstream.

## Later

- Fanatec and Thrustmaster follow-up using identified builds and support bundles.
- Per-wheel starting settings once enough reports exist. Keep the successful
  R12 and Reddit-user settings as observations, not universal defaults.
- Consider Logitech-specific effects only after generic condition/periodic effects.
- Nexus distribution after the GitHub release is validated.
- Full game input record/playback only after a separate Unity/Rewired state and
  determinism design. MAME `.inp` playback is not portable to this game.

## Explicitly out of scope

Cockpit view, physics/assist changes, redistributing game assemblies, XInput wheel
workarounds that hide DirectInput, and runtime switching of Rewired's input backend.

## Shipped

Kept for the reasoning, not the status. Dates are when the work landed.

| Phase | What | Landed |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Prove the force feedback path.** Answered 2026-08-31: the DLL never loaded because the `ForceFeedback` behaviour is never attached — the feature was built from both ends and never joined in the middle. Route A (supply the missing DLL and let the game drive it) was dead on arrival; route B (compute the force ourselves) is what shipped. | 0.1.0 |
| 1 | **The Unity Mod Manager mod.** `Info.json`, entry point, Ctrl+F10 settings, Harmony hooks on the car's physics update. | 0.1.0 |
| 2 | **Telemetry against the real game.** Forza Horizon 324-byte packet, anchored on `Speed`@256 and `Gear`@319, verified with SimHub and a ButtKicker. | 0.1.0 |
| 3 | **Force feedback worth having.** `Mz` first, then replaced by front-axle lateral force × pneumatic trail after `Mz` proved to reverse sign mid-corner. Low-speed fade, sign settled across three wheels, re-acquire after focus loss. | 0.2.1 |
| 4 | **Bonnet camera**, and a bumper view beside it, appended to the game's own rotation with a numpad tuner. | 0.2.0 |
| 5 | **Make it shareable.** Public repo, MIT, tagged releases with a double-click installer, user-facing README and troubleshooting. | 0.1.0 → 0.2.2 |
