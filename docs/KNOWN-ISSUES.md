### KI-47 — Shared wheel handle does not recover after device disappearance

Owner reported missing steering/throttle on October 9 after a Wheelkit profile
apply. The Apply log lists only panel width, height and eye distance; Art's
saved control bindings remain present. Camera cycling still follows its native
game binding: Wheelkit does not yet apply profile controls.

Art 0.4.2-rc.3 initially read the R12 both before and after FFB initialization.
At 20:03:42 local the R12 vanished from DirectInput enumeration while shifter
and stalk remained; six seconds later it returned. Every subsequent reader
reopen reused the existing FFB handle, and the R12 stayed NOT RESPONDING until
exit. Owner says the base stayed powered and a separate USB camera was
unplugged/replugged on another hub. That is context, not proof of a USB cause.
The initial loss and any earlier control symptom remain unqualified.

Candidate fix: observe the selected FFB device's existing input-read health,
request bounded recovery after two seconds of failed observations, and reuse
the existing strict-identity, focused-idle reconnect path. One request per
outage; reader reopen/failed retries do not replenish it. A half second of
healthy observations or an explicit identity change permits a new outage.
No native pin, force curve, binding or geometry changes. Tests pass; attended
recovery remains pending. [Evidence and validation](reviews/2026-10-09-input-recovery.md).


### KI-46 — Menu button prompts overlap and show gamepad symbols for a wheel

**Owner-reported 2026-10-06 on 0.4.1-rc.2 (screenshot).** Some menu prompts, for
example "next weather", draw a keyboard badge ("space") with a PlayStation
triangle on top of it, as if keyboard and controller prompts were both shown.
With a wheel the prompt should name the wheel button bound to that action.

Cause (decompiled 2026-10-07): the prompts are `ControllerButtonDisplay`. For a
joystick its `SetupGlpyh` switches the text off and asks `ControllerGlyphs` for
artwork by `hardwareTypeGuid`; an unrecognised wheel has none, and the method
then changes nothing else, so the image keeps its last (gamepad) sprite and the
keyboard badge stays as the keyboard left it. **Fix candidate (unreleased,
`PromptGlyphFallback`, not yet seen in game):** with no artwork, the stale image
is hidden and the badge shows the bound wheel element ("B12"), as `GlyphFallback`
does on the controls screen. Severity: cosmetic.
### KI-44 — Open game bindings locks up the game again (0.4.0-rc.3)

**Owner-reported 2026-10-04, blocking for that route; KI-42 regression.** In
0.4.0-rc.3, with triple screens in separate-displays mode and the developer probe
installed, pressing **Open game bindings** in Wheel settings locked up the game.
The owner had to close it. Player.log has no exception and no GameBindings warning.
That session also logged "Failed to change display to ExclusiveFullscreen…
reverting to FullscreenWindow" and switched from Windowed to FullScreenWindow.

Lead, not confirmed: `GameBindings.Tick` defers the hand-off through
`MenuInputBarrier.Blocks(…, Application.isFocused, …)`. If the game window never
regains focus, the hand-off waits forever with the panel closed and no menu
input. In separate-displays mode, `SideWindowFocusRestorer` raises the side
windows (SWP_NOACTIVATE), so focus may sit on the wrong window. KI-42 was fixed
and tested without the merged triple code.

October 4 follow-up: the handoff now has a five-second unscaled deadline. If
focus or a held control prevents it, the request is cancelled and Wheel settings
reopens with recovery instructions. Regression tests cover focus loss, a held
control, no delayed opening after timeout, and a successful retry. The original
runtime trigger and a live triple-screen retest remain open; this bounds the
known indefinite-wait path without claiming the graphics lockup is diagnosed.
Workaround: use the game's own Options → Controls.

### KI-43 — 0.2.6 binding and calibration may not capture a separate TSS handbrake

**T300/TSS user report, 2026-09-29; major, unconfirmed root cause.** Existing
0.2.5 assignments, including an inverted analog TSS handbrake, worked after
upgrading to 0.2.6; the handbrake preview travelled 0–100%. After changing
bindings, attempts to Bind/Calibrate wheel, pedals and handbrake showed no
new input. Wheel/pedals still drove, but the separate handbrake did not. The
reporter restored the handbrake in 0.2.5, then reused that setting in 0.2.6.
Do not infer that the 0.2.6 reader cannot read TSS: it demonstrably read the
saved binding. We lack a support file from the failed state and do not know
whether the stage was paused, **Use assigned controls** was Off, or **Clear**
was pressed.

The 0.2.6 Bind action changed from immediate assignment to a full-travel,
release and Save calibration flow. Review found a routine Bind closed all
working USB readers, while Calibrate rediscovered an axis instead of keeping
the saved one. Version 0.2.7 keeps responsive readers, retries a
listed reader that failed to open, fixes Calibrate to the saved axis, and puts
the paused/assigned-controls status at the top of Controls. Fixture tests pass;
the owner cleared and rebound a MOZA handbrake on installed 0.2.7-rc.1, then
reported a good drive. The game log recorded a successful bind and Settings.xml
contained the saved axis. The owner initially saw "not assigned" after Save;
the panel also has a separate, unused **Handbrake (button)** row, but which row
showed that text has not been confirmed. This is evidence for MOZA persistence,
not a T300/TSS fresh-bind pass. T300/TSS and the in-game label retest remain
pending. Ask for a support file **while
the failure is present, before reinstalling** and note pause state, the top
status text, and whether the TSS axis preview moves. See
[troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#bindings-do-not-detect-a-wheel-pedal-or-separate-handbrake).

### KI-41 — Simple binding layout lacks clear visual ownership

**Owner-reported, 2026-09-21; RC13/RC14 review extended 2026-09-22.** RC12's axis
labels and generic action rows had little visual separation. RC13 added local
groups, but the owner found the rendered panel still cluttered: its cards lacked
enough contrast, navigation looked like another bank of command buttons, the
Setup page repeated Controls/FFB content and row actions remained oversized.
RC14 added bordered higher-contrast cards, flat selected tabs and removed Setup,
but its remaining full-width Help/actions still read as section delimiters. RC15
uses compact commands, segmented choices and flat links. The owner's RC15 FFB
screenshot still shows the device selector expanded as full-width command bars
and Refresh as a full-width button. Released 0.2.6 bounds the picker, shows
explicit choice markers and makes Refresh compact. The owner accepted RC16
overall; focused rendered acceptance of those FFB choices is still pending. See
[changes and exact checks](reviews/2026-09-21-visual-grouping.md). Do not close
this issue based solely on a build or policy-height assertion.

### KI-40 — Settings input reaches native menus; default 4K content is too small

**Confirmed in RC9, 2026-09-19.** Down changed the stock main-menu selection
behind the open settings panel. Escape cancelled a camera binding but also
opened the game's Quit confirmation. The default-scale4K text was too small.
RC10 dispatch/release guards and scoped content scaling are reviewed, passed
all16 gates and installed. RC10's live Down/Return/Escape isolation and native
menu recovery passed, but its larger4K content overflowed the default UMM host.
RC12 constrains width, wraps page buttons and stacks large-scale binding rows;
all16 gates and narrow source review passed, exact package installed. Its limited
4K checks passed header/page-button fit, all six Simple page tops, camera nested
scrolling, timed Bind→Escape cancellation and native Quit recovery. The valid
cancel request arrived at8.218s, before the10s capture timeout; the panel stayed
open and the native menu did not react. Advanced Cameras top was observed;
the full Advanced, custom-scale and broader input matrix remains pending.
See [RC10/RC12 evidence](reviews/2026-09-19-rc10-ui-smoke.md).
Offline checks alone do not close this issue. Exact evidence, restored settings
and the required retest are in [the smoke review](reviews/2026-09-19-rc9-ui-smoke.md).

### KI-39 — Settings UX runtime and layout acceptance is incomplete

**Unverified, candidate 2026-09-19.** The Simple/Advanced implementation includes
transactional calibration, additive USB handbrake, Settings/Stop/camera buttons,
strict FFB following, and a guarded route to the game's controls panel. Source
fixtures do not establish real UMM scrolling/focus, device behavior or physical
stop/recovery. At 720p/high DPI, walk all pages and test fresh/legacy settings,
calibration/cancellation, binding writes and USB reconnect. See the
[adoption audit and exact pending checklist](UX-OVERNIGHT-2026-09-16.md).

Review found and fixed three pre-deployment defects: failed binding writes became
effective despite an unchanged file, and Restore numpad defaults could conflict
with a rebound Settings key, and new camera/Settings keyboard shortcuts could
overlap native game actions. Locked-file/retry/cancel and batch/native-map
preflight fixtures cover these. RC9 passed all 16 gates and was installed with
the owner's settings retained, but its live smoke found KI-40. RC12 supersedes it.
These fixes are not evidence that
the attended checklist has passed. Game action binding retains the native
Rewired UI; Raw Input-unreadable devices need keyboard/pad for those actions.

### KI-38 — Accepted RC3/RC4 crash commands have no distinct felt effect

**T300 at 50%, 2026-10-05 (0.2.6 support file).** First report at the new
default: Crash strength 50, steering Strength 40, T300 RS (single-axis effect).
56 crash cues, all driver-accepted, no rejections, one early stop. The user
"doesn't feel the crashes". The final cue (28.5 m/s normal speed, intensity 1,
magnitude 0.5000, 120 ms constant pulse, stopped after 134 ms) began with the
steering command at exactly 0, because the front wheels were off the ground. So
neither a low saved strength nor steering masking or saturation explains that one.
Earlier mid-corner cues (0.23, 0.37) overlapped steering commands of about
-0.2, which a fixed +X pulse partly cancels. Leads for an owner rig comparison,
not yet tried: a longer pulse (250–300 ms), a two-sided knock, and a direction
taken from the impact or opposing the current steering force. Wheel-side
filtering and real torque are still unmeasured.

Owner chose a standalone comparison first (2026-10-05):
[`tools/testing/CrashFeel`](../tools/testing/CrashFeel/README.md) plays the
current pulse and six alternatives (longer pulses, knock, 12 Hz crunch, push +
rattle, in-steering push), with or without a ±20% cornering load. It uses only
existing toolkit calls and records 1–4 ratings to a CSV. Owner run on the MOZA
R12, all at 50%, + direction, no cornering load: A (current 120 ms) clear,
B 250 ms clear, C 400 ms too strong, D knock faint, E 12 Hz crunch faint,
**F push + rattle clear and "most realistic"**, G in-steering 250 ms too strong
(B and G share magnitude and duration). One rating each; load and direction
were not compared. Note that A was "clear" here at 50% while the in-game cue at
the owner's saved 19.5% was not felt. 0.4.1-rc.2 plays F for crashes; whether it
is felt in game, mid-corner and on a T300 is the open question.

**Current lead, 2026-09-29:** the latest installed 0.2.7-rc.1 game log shows
five accepted crash cues with ordinary expiry at roughly 121–130 ms. The
strongest was a full-intensity 25.4 m/s normal-speed contact, but the owner's
preserved setting was **19.52381%**, so the request was only **0.1952** nominal
force. The 50% value is a default for new settings, not a migration. Test the
same constant-pulse implementation with Crash strength manually set to 50
before changing waveform, duration, collision thresholds or toolkit output.
Driver acceptance and log timing are not physical torque measurements. See
[current investigation](research/2026-09-29-crash-shift-feedback.md).

**Owner-confirmed feel failure in RC3 and shaped RC4 (2026-09-17 UTC).**
RC3 logs contain 13 accepted crash cues, six at full configured intensity and
about 19.5% nominal amplitude. Owner felt no distinct crash effect. This is not
explained by confusing Pit House global gain with the mod's steering-only gain.
Existing output was three identical 25 Hz cycles over 120 ms; waveform and early
stop timing are leads, not a proven driver diagnosis. No landing cues occurred.

RC4 replaced only crash shape with a 6.25 Hz/120 ms peak-start sine and
full-lifetime fade, using the upstream shaped-burst API. Peak limits, collision
detection, steering and motion signals remain unchanged. Managed expiry now starts
after native Play returns; per-event timing/reason diagnostics distinguish
expiry, replacement and lifecycle cancellation. Parameter readback cannot prove
physical waveform. See [evidence and test plan](reviews/2026-09-17-crash-kick.md).

RC4's original support file and UMM log contain three unique full-intensity
head-on cues at .1952, all accepted with exact requested-shape readback. Managed
stops occurred 124.52–131.80 ms after Play returned, with zero early stops.
Owner again felt nothing and explicitly confirmed normal steering FFB worked.
The first cue began with steering -.0071, so steering saturation cannot explain
every absent cue. The support file repeats log tails; do not double-count them.
Single-axis Cartesian direction zero is Microsoft's documented setup, not a
proven zero-force defect. In-game native PLAYING status and physical output were
unmeasured, leading to the standalone comparison below.
[RC4 evidence](reviews/2026-09-17-rc4-crash-feel.md).

The first standalone tester falsely blocked BorderlessGaming.exe as a game,
so the owner's A/B/C attempt never reached acquisition. Developer-tool fix
`2066351` uses exact game names and displays the blocker name/PID; its read-only
preflight passes with Borderless Gaming still running. The Desktop shortcut is
updated. This unblocks the diagnostic, not the underlying crash-feel failure.

The first completed A/B/C test recorded eight accepted/PLAYING requests at
5% and 20%; both C tests retained PLAYING through three zero-steering updates.
Owner only faintly felt A at 20%, and requested more range. Optional
30/40% tester choices are installed via `38bbfa7`, with the same waveforms/durations and 5%
starting setting. API gain/status readbacks do not establish motor torque or
Pit House settings; the underlying crash response remains unaccepted.

The subsequent four-request 40% comparison favored constant pulse A, still too
weak for the owner. Owner requests a constant crash jolt, default50/range0–100,
and sharing the findings in the toolkit. The tester now offers that range;
installed RC6 uses a finite constant pulse with independent cached
handles and one active impact. Landing stays default5/range0–40. No stronger
physical or in-game acceptance yet. All 16 local gates pass; saved strength19.52381
is preserved. See [follow-through](reviews/2026-09-17-constant-crash.md).

### KI-37 — Native force tracing performs synchronous driving I/O by default

**Confirmed implementation overhead; fix shipped in 0.2.6, hardware retest pending.**
Official toolkit v0.13.0 logs each changing `SetDeviceForcesXY` value through
open/write/close on the calling physics thread, independent of the mod's support
logging checkbox. Upstream local candidate `82c7891` (native 0.6.1) gates only
routine force samples behind `DBCE_FFB_TRACE_FORCE=1`; lifecycle/errors remain.
Both architectures pass production-adapter fake-output tests with identical
force values, directions, flags and repeated-value delivery. No wheel was
attached during upstream smoke; this is not a live FFB or stutter verification.
The consumer now pins official toolkit v0.15.0 with binaries identical to the
tested local candidate. This removes the packaging blocker, but does not prove
the reported in-game stutter is fixed; a cold-stage comparison remains pending.
See [investigation and evidence](reviews/2026-09-16-landing-startup-investigation.md).

### KI-36 — Landing vibration may precede visible touchdown on Haapajarvi

**Unverified timing; reported 2026-09-16 on 0.2.5.** T300/TSS reporter uses
landing strength 20 and feels it slightly early on Finland Haapajarvi. No
support file/video received yet. Current detector fires at first wheel contact;
the saved Norway drive shows that flag one physics step before compression.
That is a lead, not proof of this reporter's timing or a calibrated delay.
Request original support file, car/direction and a short landing clip. Preserve
the accepted waveform and timing until contact/load/render timing is correlated.
2026-09-16 investigation: game wheel contact is a physics raycast, visible wheel
position is updated separately, and the game's own landing cue waits for all
wheels. The Norway difference is 16.67 ms; it is not a prescribed correction.
Candidate support diagnostics retain the last detector event's mask, compression
fraction and time to compression/all-wheel contact. These are physics proxies,
not video or measured actuator timing. Detection and output are unchanged.
See [findings and reproduction plan](reviews/2026-09-16-landing-startup-investigation.md).

Release note 2026-09-13: owner accepted RC8 and authorized 0.2.5 with default-on
wheel landing vibration. The built-in SimHub thud felt better; amplifier CLIP was
observed. This overall acceptance does not resolve the individual unverified
hardware cases below. [Release evidence](reviews/2026-09-13-release-0.2.5.md).

### KI-32 — Settings explanations ignore Mod Manager font scaling

**Cosmetic; reported 2026-09-12, confirmed in source.** The T300/TSS user can
enlarge ordinary settings text through UMM, but explanations stay small.
`SettingsPanel.Help` forces an 11-pixel font; section headers also force 14 pixels.
The wrapped status style is cached beyond UMM's font replacement.

Version 0.2.5 now inherits the current label style for help and headers,
and refreshes the wrapped/help styles each draw. Local UMM inspection confirms
its scale setting replaces `GUI.skin.font`; no extra multiplier is needed.
Visual confirmation at normal and enlarged scale remains pending. Version 0.2.4
still has the defect. Handbrake, logging and smoothing help is also clearer;
input behavior, force arithmetic and saved settings are unchanged.

RC7 was installed after all 16 local gates including the recorded drive corpus;
[exact package and receipt](LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md). Those checks do not render the UI.

**2026-09-11 update:** KI-28 has focused-window/idle acquisition recovery; the
shipping mod now releases outputs before menu Quit. Probe 0.2.5.3 corrects a
shutdown hang reproduced with actual Mono (KI-30). KI-29's two local DSS gauge
screens now have stopped-game zero bindings and SimHub has reloaded both
displays; physical retest is pending. RC5's failed receipt remains unchanged. See
[current fixes and evidence](reviews/2026-09-11-bug-follow-up.md).

### KI-30 — Alt+F4 hangs with the developer probe installed

**Owner report on RC5 + probe 0.2.5.2; cause unconfirmed.** The retry had no FFB
(KI-28); the owner used Alt+F4 and reported a hang. The log reaches Unity quit
callbacks, saves a 2,169-frame/zero-force capture, and closes native input readers.
The process was gone by the subsequent stop attempt. This does not rule out a
temporary hang or identify what eventually ended it. No matching Windows crash/
hang report was found in the checked event window.

Keep separate from KI-27's process-kill menu action. Investigate probe pipe/thread
shutdown and save duration, then compare the same Alt+F4 path without the probe.
The old control pipe now reproduces a cleanup hang under isolated Unity Mono;
the corrected cancellation/teardown passes listening, reading and queued-command
cases. This establishes a hang mechanism, not the sole cause of the owner's
specific run. Do not call ordinary game shutdown verified end-to-end.

### KI-29 — Gauges retain finish-line speed after stage end and exit

**Owner report on RC5; consumer-visible failure, cause unconfirmed.** During the
first jump drive, gauges stayed at the speed recorded at the finish line and
remained there after quitting. SimHub logged Game disconnected at 21:12:50.865,
matching the mod's final zero-force/idle diagnostic time; the UDP reader timed out
later. Thus SimHub saw a race-state change, but the report says display values did
not reset.

Production `TelemetryPump.Park` sends three zeroed race-off packets, and inactive
physics frames are zeroed. Existing loopback checks establish packet delivery/
race state, not display clearing. Inspect the installed Forza consumer's handling
of race-off data and gauge bindings; reproduce the transition with a receiver/
display check before changing the packet sequence. ExitGame's forced-kill path
also bypasses normal mod shutdown without a pending probe capture. Do not mask
this with a force tune or claim an upstream encoder defect without evidence.

### KI-28 — Startup FFB acquisition failure stays unavailable for the session

**Confirmed on owner's RC5 retry, before probe load.** Player.log reports
`FFB initialise/start failed (0x80040205)`. Native logs show effect creation
succeeded, effect start lost exclusive acquisition, and reacquisition failed with
`0x80070578` (invalid window handle), then the wrapper shut down. RC5 had no
automatic startup retry. Direct input still opened all four readers;
the owner had steering input but no FFB. The capture consequently has zero force
rows. FFB remained enabled, strength 50, smoothing 0.2; nothing intentionally
turned it off.

The supplied foreground window was outside the game process, so native code
selected an own-process window. The failure suggests startup window/focus timing;
which window became invalid still needs confirmation. Version 0.2.5 defers
initial acquisition until a valid owned foreground window is stable, with five
idle attempts at five-second intervals. Wheel/shifter readers close before
acquisition and reopen using saved identity. Current explicit retry is the
FFB Enabled off/on control or wheel reselection while paused; hardware recovery
from this particular failure has not been tested. Native window/lifecycle changes,
if needed, belong upstream. FFB lifecycle is marked failed in RC5's attended gate.

### KI-27 — Normal menu Quit bypasses developer capture saving

**Reproduced on the owner's RC5 drive; corrected in probe 0.2.5.2, attended
quit-save check pending.** The owner used the normal Quit option after a drive
with jumps. Recording counters had advanced, but no capture directory was written.
The game's `ExitGame.Exit` calls `Process.GetCurrentProcess().Kill()`, bypassing
Unity's OnApplicationQuit/OnDestroy and the probe's shutdown postfix. No crash
or user misuse is required. The unsaved motion/contact buffers were lost.

The developer probe now prefixes that menu action: if a capture is pending, it
calls the mod's normal output shutdown, whose probe postfix writes the capture.
The kill is allowed only once the buffers are saved; a release/save failure
cancels that quit and logs the retained-capture status for an explicit Stop retry.
Version 0.2.5 also releases outputs on this menu action, with
or without a capture; the probe remains responsible only for saving/cancellation.
Tests cover no-op exit, failed release/write, missing save, successful retry and
actual Harmony attachment to ExitGame.Exit. The new probe loads in Unity and
explicit START/STOP produced a menu-only capture with verified hashes. An abandoned
retry saved through Unity quit callbacks (zero force rows), but the separate
process-kill menu hook is still untested. Until confirmed, pause, issue STOP, verify
the saved manifest/CSVs, then quit. [Drive evidence](reviews/2026-09-10-attended-rc5.md).

### KI-25 — Telemetry connection work runs from physics; disabling can leave live output

**Reproduced connection path offline; corrected in 0.2.5, live consumers
pending.** `Emit` called `EnsureSender`, which constructed the shared sender while
UNDERWAY, including synchronous hostname resolution for non-IP destinations.
Actual production connection code reproduced socket creation in driving state;
the failure is preserved in `results/overnight-025-telemetry-connection-baseline.log`.
Static review also found the telemetry checkbox simply stopped emission: the
watchdog did not park it until the player stopped driving.

Connection setup now runs only in the idle watchdog after force release. A
working destination remains active during a driving edit; the new host/port
applies after pause. Disabled telemetry parks and closes on the next watchdog
tick, including while driving; repeated ticks are quiet. The actual shared sender
and loopback receivers verify those transitions. This does not establish a cause
for the reported slowdown. UDP sends remain synchronous; a bounded worker is a
possible later transport improvement, requiring delivery/lifecycle design and
measurement. Toolkit packet encoding and physics sampling are unchanged.

### KI-24 — Binding edits can write settings during driving

**Reproduced offline; corrected in 0.2.5, UI validation pending.** An
assignment started while paused could complete after resuming and synchronously
save Settings.xml. Flip/Clear also saved immediately even if the panel was open
over active driving. Assignment now cancels on resume; edits use the existing
idle/deferred-save path. Real locked-file tests retain the previous XML and retry
the latest edit. No evidence links this specific interaction to a reported hitch.

### KI-23 — Separate shifter picker trusts a stale device index

**Reproduced offline; corrected in 0.2.5, hardware validation pending.**
`Shifter.Open` ignored the stored name and opened the saved index. Restart or
another controller-list refresh could make it open another USB device. The
panel also cached labels while the shared native table could be refreshed.

Explicit selections now store a GUID from the picker snapshot, then resolve that
identity against a fresh table before opening. The displayed selection also
resolves that identity in the cached picker snapshot, not the old USB index.
Unique legacy names upgrade via
idle persistence; missing, malformed or ambiguous identities do not fall back to
an index. Shifter setup is pause-only. Close/reopen clears the old gear latch;
stage changes already reset it in ShifterPatch. Automatic native hotplug recovery
and TSS/Fanatec confirmation are not claimed.

### KI-22 — Missing front-wheel data leaves the last force active

**Reproduced offline; corrected in 0.2.5, hardware validation pending.**
With game state still UNDERWAY, missing axles/front/left/right wheel made
`FfbController.DriveWheel` return before zeroing a prior force. The watchdog also
considered the game driving, so it did not release that output. Missing/invalid
samples now clear filter state and the published game force, and release output.
Loss of native readiness clears history before recovery. The valid force formula
and tune are unchanged. 19 consumer callback tests use real shared arithmetic
and a fake output sink; no physical force was sent or runtime occurrence claimed.

### KI-21 — Direct-input identity fallback and missing-reader rediscovery

**Input correctness; reproduced offline in 0.2.4, corrected in 0.2.5;
hardware validation pending.** Legacy channel bindings stored a name and index.
`Resolve` trusted the index or selected the first same-name controller, so
identical devices could supply the wrong axis after USB order changed. A missing
handbrake was not rediscovered while another reader remained open.

Fake-transport integration reproductions fail on the release source. New
assignments append a strict instance GUID from the existing toolkit API; a missing
GUID never falls back to another device. Unique legacy names upgrade after a
successful read using deferred persistence. Multiple attached same-name devices,
including failed opens, require explicit reassignment. Rediscovery occurs only
while idle, at most once per five seconds, or on explicit Assign while paused.
Physical unplug/reconnect and two-TSS/Fanatec confirmation remain pending. No
native change or force tuning is involved; the separate shifter picker is not
covered by this axis-binding fix; its later audit/fix is tracked separately in KI-23.

### KI-19 — Rare frame-rate drops during longer T300 sessions

**User report; cause unconfirmed.** The follow-up describes occasional slowdowns
without a repeatable pattern, unlike KI-5's first 10–15 seconds. Exact mod build,
driver, logging state, location and camera-mod version are unknown. Do not merge
the reports or claim that camera saves, telemetry or another mod caused this one.

The owner's later RC4 drive exposed KI-20. That is a candidate explanation to
investigate, not proof of the same cause on the T300 user's system.

2026-10-05 data point from the same user (0.2.6, detail logging on throughout):
6,152 measured driving intervals, maximum 24.2 ms, none at 33 ms or above.
The previous session had 21,213 frames, maximum 50.5 ms, two above 33 ms, all in
its first 15 s, none at 100 ms. No slowdown was reported for these sessions.

0.2.4 adds opt-in aggregate frame-hitch counters (foreground driving only), bounded
recent log reads, recent native errors, loaded-mod versions and cached input values
to support files. No per-frame log/file writes or recorder timeline are added by
the counters. Existing detailed force traces still have overhead; compare logging
off/on if needed. Collect immediately after a short reproduction while paused.
Support creation now refuses to do synchronous disk work while driving. These are
diagnostic improvements, not a verified slowdown fix.

Version 0.2.5 also retains an opt-in summary at idle/normal-exit boundaries
under `%LOCALAPPDATA%/ArtOfSimRally/last-session-frame-health.xml`. The next mod
session includes it as previous-session evidence, with build and UTC timestamps.
It is capped at 8 KiB and rejects corrupt, future-dated or over-30-day-old data.
Failed atomic replacement preserves the old file; idle retry is bounded. No
per-frame disk work, timeline or guaranteed crash recovery is added.

### KI-18 — Nexus Camera Mod and mounted cameras compete for rotation slots

**Source-confirmed compatibility defect; guarded in 0.2.4, screen test pending.**
CameraMod 0.3.1 appends two views but assumes its settings live at slots 8/9; its
editor indexes by camera enum. Our mounted placeholders can occupy those slots
first, and both tuners share numpad keys. Reproduced slot displacement with the
actual consumer camera code and the other mod's documented list assumptions.
This does not establish that it caused issue #1 or the new FPS report.

When UMM has loaded `CameraMod`, 0.2.4 leaves its rotation alone and
suspends our mounted views/tuning. Settings remain intact and the panel explains
the choice. To use our mounts, disable that mod before a fresh game launch. Tests
cover both initialization orders and normal mounts without it. This is supported
isolation, not simultaneous operation of both camera editors. See the
[feedback review](reviews/2026-09-08-feedback-review.md).

### KI-17 — Legacy steering-assist checkbox is not a live numeric override

**2026-10-05:** the game's own options are now mapped in
[FINDINGS](FINDINGS.md#steering-options-and-autocentre-addendum--2026-10-05).
The game's on/off Steer assist limiter is skipped while a recognised wheel is
the last controller used. A "20" can only be a 0–20 index (steering sensitivity
or deadzone) or a "20%" label (those two, or stability assist). 0.4.1-rc.1
support files print all five options as the menu shows them. The T300 user's
understeer trace (2026-10-05) shows steering held at 0.80 while front slip rose
to 41–44° against an ideal of about 9°, with the force going light as designed.
That reads as overdriven fronts, not a capped input. It rules out a cap in
that corner only; it does not explain every corner the user means.

**Confirmed behavior; help corrected, legacy limitation remains.** The mod sets
`CarController.steerAssistance=false` only in its Start postfix, only when Direct
steering is enabled. It does not change saved game settings, force a numeric slider
to zero, or restore a previously captured value when unticked. The user's "20"
cannot be mapped to this boolean without identifying the exact game option.
The new label and help state the spawn-only limitation and direct users to the
game's controls. No assist behavior was changed. Leave the legacy option off and
use the game's own settings; a fresh car/game session avoids a retained override.

### KI-16 — Telemetry suspension units and motion coordinate space

**Motion/shaker signal correctness; corrected in 0.2.4, rig comparison pending.**
The 0.2.3 / 0.2.4-rc.2 baseline `FillWheels` supplies fixed maximum suspension travel as actual travel and clamps
compression measured in meters directly into the normalized slot. `BuildFrame`
also sends world-space motion where the Forza contract calls for vehicle-local
axes. The signal audit records the sources, an explicit 0.20/0.10 m counterexample
and the official format semantics in
[2026-09-08-wheel-signals.md](research/2026-09-08-wheel-signals.md).

The correction uses actual compression in meters, compression/capacity in 0..1,
and inverse car rotation for velocity, world-differentiated acceleration and
angular velocity. Acceleration history resets at park/restart/spawn, bad samples,
clock gaps/rollback and teleports. 1,230 assertions include all headings and actual
encoded UDP with distinct wheel corners. This changes motion/shaker input units
and axes; an attended rig comparison remains pending for 0.2.4. Encoder layout and wheel FFB are
unchanged. The static signal audit remains the historical baseline evidence.

### KI-15 — Direct-input cache, Flip and assignment recovery defects

**Input correctness; reproduced offline in 0.2.3, fixed in 0.2.4; detailed attended checks pending.**
Closing readers left cached values active, so a failed reopen could keep applying
the previous pedal value. Flip reflected pedal calibration around rest, making a
normal 0..65535 handbrake unusable, and flipped steering could serialize an endpoint
of -1 that the binding parser rejected on restart. Finally, a failed resting read
at Assign could make the first successful read look like movement.

Production input tests with fake transport reproduce these failures. Close/reload
now clear values; pedal Flip swaps physical endpoints; steering supports a bounded
signed calibration span in the same five-field format. Assignment waits for a valid
baseline. Tests retain analog intermediate values, unbound channels and finish/mod
disable behavior. Actual TSS input and in-game recovery remain untested.

### KI-14 — Camera tuner loses failed-save retry and logs each adjustment frame

**Persistence/supportability; reproduced in 0.2.3, fixed in 0.2.4; detailed attended checks pending.**
`CameraTuner.Update` clears `_dirty` before `Main.SaveSettings()`, ignores its
failure result and logs success unconditionally. Its timer only runs while a
mounted view is active, so switching away before the timer expires can leave the
edit unsaved until another save or mounted-view update. Held tuning keys also
produce a log line per frame. These are separate from the learned-axis save
policy fixed in KI-8; there is no evidence they caused KI-5's stage-start stutter.

Locked-file reproduction recorded one failed attempt, a false success log and no
retry. The fix uses the persistent watchdog to save while idle and retain failures
with five-second retry backoff. Held adjustments produce no per-frame log.
Production tuner/writer tests cover locked-file recovery, latest edits, debounce,
driving/disable and shutdown; lifecycle tests check output release before writes.
Attended persistence remains pending. The fix ships in 0.2.4; 0.2.3 is unchanged.

### KI-13 — TSS handbrake assignment is not discoverable through stock controls

2026-09-16 follow-up: the same reporter says the handbrake works perfectly on
0.2.5. Assignment is no longer reported blocked on that rig; axis versus button
and partial travel were not specified, so analog hardware confirmation remains.

**Setup; user report, TSS validation pending.** T300 RS GT + TSS user can assign
shifts but not handbrake in the game's controls UI. Mod version was not supplied.
The mod's direct-input panel already supports a Handbrake axis: it normalizes to
0..1 and overrides the game's float handbrake input, retaining unbound channels.
This is not evidence that TSS is unsupported or that the mod handbrake is digital.

[Direct binding steps](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#separate-handbrake-tss-or-other-usb-device)
are documented. Confirm intermediate travel, release and actual braking behavior
on the TSS before claiming hardware verification. See [user feedback](USER-FEEDBACK.md).

### KI-12 — T300 rotation panel changes from 700 to 1080 degrees after launch

**Unverified cause and physical effect; reported 2026-09-08 UTC.** The user sets
700 degrees in the Thrustmaster panel and sees 1080 after starting the modded game,
while steering still feels near 700. Driver/firmware and mod version are unknown.

No physical degrees-setting call was found in the consumer or pinned toolkit
v0.12.0 native source. The toolkit does set logical `DIPROP_RANGE` to 0..65535 and
disable autocenter. A logical axis range is not a physical rotation request;
driver response to initialization remains untested. Compare vanilla/mod/FFB/direct
input with consistent profiles and record actual lock separately from the panel.
Do not change rotation behavior or blame a component before reproducing it.

Follow-up: setting the panel back to 700 while the game runs stays at 700 on
subsequent visits. That narrows the timing but does not prove the first 1080 was
only visual or identify the physical steering range. No rotation fix claimed.

### KI-1 — Stock cameras 3–8 render reversed

**Major; open pending validation.** Reported on a T300 RS GT with mod 0.2.1 in
[issue #1](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/art-of-sim-rally/issues/1).

**New evidence (2026-09-06 UTC):** the reporter says unplugging a USB PS5
controller resolved the symptom. The attached
[support snapshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/31874196/art-of-sim-rally-support-20260905-191759.txt)
shows both mounted views disabled and `ChangeCamera <- Accelerator -`. It reports
assembly version 0.1.0.0, which cannot establish the package version. It is an
after-unplug snapshot, not a before/after reproduction; older log entries in the
same bundle must not be confused with current settings.

There is also a real code defect: the mod writes the rendering child's world
transform, while the stock CarCameras rig only moves its parent. CameraManager
initializes the child at local identity. The original code failed to restore it
when relinquishing a mounted view. The 2026-09-04 fix restores that invariant,
but tying it conclusively to this reporter's issue was premature.

The RC tracks and restores the exact child it owned, restores FOV, hands back on
stock-view selection and mod/feature disable, and selects a usable stock view
instead of leaving a zero-distance placeholder active. Offline ownership tests
pass; owner RC6 feedback on 2026-09-08 UTC says the camera worked great. This
does not reproduce the reporter's pad/binding setup. Check stock views before/after each
mounted view and compare pad attached/absent where available. Do not close the
GitHub issue solely from these code tests.

### KI-2 — The camera moves oddly at the end of a stage

**Cosmetic; fixed in 0.2.3, owner smoke passed; full matrix pending.** Observed on the owner's
rig and independently reported on Reddit for replays and stage end in 0.2.2.

The earlier parent snap did not restore the rendering child's local transform.
The two-line child fix also had a lifecycle gap: CameraManager disables
CarCameras in `EnableCinemachineCamera` and `DisableCameraManagers`, so its
LateUpdate callback need not run at the handback. Verified in the installed
build 17584229 on 2026-09-06.

The RC releases the child before those transitions, with a persistent watchdog
fallback. It does not snap the parent while the cinematic system owns it.
Owner RC6 feedback on 2026-09-08 UTC: "camera worked great". The report did not
enumerate every transition. Finish, replay, intro, pause/resume, stage restart
and unload remain checklist items; test doubles do not establish rendered correctness.

### KI-3 — Fanatec fixes are unverified on Fanatec hardware

| | |
|---|---|
| **Since** | 0.2.2, 2026-09-03 |
| **Severity** | unverified |
| **Status** | awaiting a report from the user who supplied the support bundle |

Three fixes shipped in 0.2.2 came from a single Fanatec support bundle and were
verified only by reasoning plus initialisation on a MOZA rig:

- direct wheel input (`WheelInput`) on a base Rewired cannot read;
- the crash when choosing a shifter after force feedback failed to initialise;
- trying every force-feedback candidate when the preferred device has no
  actuator.

The failure they address is specific to a base that presents twice under one
name, which no machine here does. Until a Fanatec owner confirms, treat
[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)'s Fanatec section as a best hypothesis
rather than a tested procedure.

0.2.3 adopts toolkit v0.12.0 and stores new explicit wheel selections by strict
DirectInput instance GUID. This distinguishes identically named devices; the
Fanatec setup still needs confirmation. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

---

### KI-4 — Force scaling is tuned for one wheel

2026-09-14: owner accepted landing vibration and the built-in shaker comparison
for 0.2.5; wheel landing vibration now defaults on at strength 5. The new request
is stronger crashes in wheel FFB and **SimHub motion** (FR-2). Source/UDP tests
are complete, but a labelled crash capture and motion comparison remain pending.
See [crash findings](research/2026-09-14-crash-feedback.md). This does not resolve
per-wheel tuning or the complete hardware matrix.

2026-09-12: the development landing-vibration candidate adds an independent
effect strength (default off), without retuning steering. It does not establish
per-wheel defaults or resolve the requested road/crash effects. First RC8 owner
clarification: wheel FFB is fine; the weak landing thud concerns the ButtKicker,
not the wheel. Eight wheel-driver accepted cues do not measure shaker output.
RC9's extra SimHub helper was rejected and removed. Investigate built-in Impacts
and Road impacts tuning using existing telemetry under FR-2. A 30 Hz comparison
profile is prepared; physical improvement remains untested.
[Evidence and next comparison](reviews/2026-09-12-landing-wheel-test.md).
Full hardware validation remains open; see [LANDING-EFFECTS.md](LANDING-EFFECTS.md).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Severity** | major on hardware unlike a MOZA R12 |
| **Status** | open by design; `Strength` is the mitigation |

`FyReference` sets what lateral force counts as full scale, and it has been
retuned twice on the same rig (6,000 → 8,000 → 11,500 N). A gear-driven
Logitech and a 12 Nm direct-drive base want very different numbers, and only
`Strength` is exposed in the panel; `FyReference` itself is Settings.xml only.

This is tuning, not incompatibility — nothing in the force path is
vendor-specific. It stays open because there is no per-wheel default and no way
to acquire one without reports.

Data points so far:

| Rig | Base gain | Strength | Smoothing | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MOZA R12 (owner, 2026-09-04) | — | **26** | 0.2 | Historical setting after the `FyReference` retunes; not the current installation |
| Unstated wheel + motion platform (Reddit, 2026-09-04) | 100% | **15** | **0.50** | "works perfect"; raised smoothing specifically to kill notchiness over low-poly inclines |
| MOZA R12 (owner, RC6 drive 2026-09-08 UTC) | — | **50** | 0.2 | Strength from live log and preserved settings; owner reports no control issues, not a separate force-tuning comparison |
| Thrustmaster T300 RS GT (message recorded 2026-09-08 UTC) | 80–90% overall; effect categories 100% | not supplied | not supplied | Wants light steering with strong surface/landing/crash feedback; see FR-2 in USER-FEEDBACK |

The first two reports favored lower gain; the owner subsequently used 50. These
observations do not justify a universal new default. The T300 request also needs
independent effect gains rather than merely a third retune on one rig's opinion.

---

### KI-5 — Stage start stutters and briefly locks up for 10–15 seconds

2026-09-16: the 0.2.5 reporter now describes a slight hitch within the first five
seconds on Finland Haapajarvi, unsure whether it occurs without the mod. Keep
this milder report separate from the original duration/severity. Support file
created but not received; no new diagnosis or resolution claimed.

Local investigation found KI-37's synchronous force trace; its candidate fix
removes avoidable I/O without establishing this report's cause. Both saved
owner drives have first-five-second intervals below 25 ms. One later 86 ms
interval was missed by the old 100 ms hitch threshold. New diagnostics split
first 5s/next 10s/later and count 33/50/100 ms intervals; cold stage, restart and
mod-disabled comparisons on the reported track remain pending.

**Major; plausible contributor fixed, reported symptom unverified.** A Reddit
user first noticed this with 0.2.2. It is not established whether it occurs on
every restart, every new stage or only a cold launch.

`WheelInput` previously saved Settings.xml synchronously when learned ranges
extended, rate-limited to five seconds. Those writes could occur during the
opening seconds of driving. The 2026-09-04 change keeps range updates in memory
and defers disk writes. RC review additionally fixes a failed-save path that
cleared the dirty flag anyway, and moves shutdown persistence after output release.
Failed saves now stay pending and retry at most every five seconds while idle.

Offline policy and shutdown-order checks pass. They do not demonstrate that disk
IO caused the user's stutter. Owner RC6 testing on 2026-09-08 UTC reported
"no stutter"; the original Reddit report is not yet confirmed resolved.
Compare cold stage, same-stage
restart, different stage, and mod-disabled baseline using the optional capture
and [testing checklist](PRE-RELEASE-TESTING.md).

If it persists, investigate device discovery/opening on the first direct-input
update, native driver polling, and game/shader loading. FFB is not strictly
arithmetic-only: it calls native SetForce, and DiagnosticLogging formats/writes
traces. Keep diagnostic settings consistent across comparisons. Explicit camera
tuner and UI saves remain user-triggered and are not the learned-range hot path.

### KI-6 — The wheel snaps back as the car straightens out of a slide

**Major for feel; open.** The Reddit user praised 0.2.2 with wheel FFB at 100%,
mod Strength 15 and Smoothing 0.50, but reported snapback/tank slappers in powerful
RWD cars. That report does not establish a single cause or justify physics changes.

The current output has a lateral-force/trail signal and smoothing, with no explicit
wheel-rate damper. A hardware damper is a candidate experiment; wheelbase settings,
filter delay, changing tyre forces and the car's own behaviour also matter.
Toolkit condition effects are available but unused. Keep this work out of the
maintenance RC; tune against attended captures and compare at the reporter's settings.

### KI-7 — Candidate identity and native-path diagnostics were misleading

**Supportability; fixed in 0.2.3, live support output pending.** Info.json remained
0.2.2 and the assembly remained 0.1.0.0 regardless of the requested zip name.
LoadedPath only recorded a preload request, and version diagnostics could load
the plugin. Documentation incorrectly told users to delete the installer’s
intentional Plugins/x86_64 copy.

RC packages now enforce numeric version consistency and embed the RC/revision/
source state; support reports include the managed file hash and observed resident
native modules, their versions and disk hashes, without loading a module for
inspection. Multiple mapped copies are reported as ambiguous. Compare against
the candidate manifest; a plugin path or a lower native version alone is not stale.

### KI-8 — A failed deferred save discarded the retry; shutdown saved before release

**Major lifecycle defect; fixed in 0.2.3, game persistence check pending.** The
dirty flag was cleared before Main.SaveSettings, which swallowed write errors.
Shutdown also wrote settings before zeroing the wheel. The save API now returns
success, dirty state survives failures and output release happens before disk IO.
Executable regression checks cover failures, retry timing and ordering.

The installed UMM implementation also catches errors internally in ModSettings.Save.
The RC therefore uses the same XML serialization format through an exception-reporting
writer, then atomically replaces Settings.xml. A real locked-file regression confirms
failure leaves the previous XML intact, keeps the retry pending, and recovers after
the lock is released. Actual Settings fields roundtrip through the serializer.

### KI-9 — Toolkit sync can leave a mixed pin on failure

**Tooling; fixed upstream and adopted, 2026-09-07.** Sync preflights all requested
parts/files/local edits, stages a replacement and rolls back a failed commit.
Unknown/missing/empty parts fail before destination changes. Partial syncs retain
other manifest entries and nested paths; forced edits retain backups. Upstream
real-filesystem regression covers copying failure and rollback. Local pins name
the full source revision and dirty state. Hashes prove integrity, not independent
release provenance.

### KI-10: Toolkit adoption lifecycle defects

**Major; fixed upstream/consumer, attended verification pending.** Shared wrapper
could bind the wrong native filename on Mono; selectors could remain stale; a
shared read slot could follow a different FFB wheel; Panic left managed readiness
true; final input-only shutdown could retain DirectInput. Toolkit 0.12 addresses
these with exact-handle bindings, strict GUID selection, slot identity, corrected
readiness and final ShutdownAll. Consumer readers refresh on FFB switches and all
inputs release before persistence. The FFB checkbox immediately zeroes output when
disabled and initializes FFB when enabled after a disabled launch. Nonfinite force
is zeroed before conversion to a device integer. Malformed saved bindings are rejected before indexing axis/button arrays.
No new force tune is introduced.


---

### KI-11 — Telemetry could stay disabled after correcting a failed destination

**0.2.4 follow-up:** the shared sender returns false on a socket failure instead
of throwing. The consumer now observes that return, disposes the failed sender
and waits for an endpoint edit or explicit restart. The revised transport test
closes an actual UDP socket under the production sender, exercising the full
failure path instead of directly calling the consumer error handler. This is a
consumer contract correction; no toolkit repin or encoder change was needed.

**Supportability; fixed in 0.2.3, live consumer check pending.**
`_senderFailed` was checked before endpoint changes and was not reset by shutdown.
After one connection/send failure, editing host/port or toggling telemetry could
leave it disabled for the rest of the session. Failed attempts now remember their
endpoint, stay quiet until it changes or is explicitly restarted, and dispose the
failed socket. Production-code loopback tests cover recovery, three parked packets,
destination switching and repeat shutdown. SimHub remains an attended gate.

## Resolved

### KI-45 — "Log detail for support" stays on across launches

**Reported 2026-10-05 by the T300/TSS user on 0.2.6; fixed in 0.4.1 (owner
tested 0.4.1-rc.2 at the rig and approved it for release, 2026-10-06).** The user found the toggle already on before they wanted
a log. The default has always been off (checked at every tag from v0.1.0), but
the setting was saved, so turning it on for an earlier support request kept FFB
trace lines going to the UMM log five times a second for every later session.
Their native `ffb.log` had also reached 89.9 MB, mostly force traces written by
toolkit builds before KI-37's fix, because nothing ever trims it.

0.4.1-rc.1 turns the toggle off at every launch (logged once when it was left
on) and its help says so. `ffb.log` over 8 MB is kept as `ffb.previous.log` at
startup. SettingsUi and Support suites cover both.
Severity: cosmetic (disk use and log noise; this user's frame health was clean).

### KI-42 — Open game bindings can leave the native screen without input

**Owner-confirmed on RC14; fixed and owner-tested on RC15, 2026-09-22.** The
native Controls screen opened but ignored input. RC15 waits for the initiating
UMM control to release for two frames, clears the general close barrier, then
hands input to the game. The owner reports the route worked in a live test.
Offline checks cover focus, held input, cancellation and delayed handoff. The
broader settings input matrix remains tracked by KI-40.

### KI-35 — Adding a second regression capture fails to replace the index

**Developer tooling; reproduced/fixed 2026-09-15.** PowerShell converts `$null`
to an empty string for `File.Replace`'s backup filename, which .NET rejects.
The new case files were copied/verified but the original one-case index remained
intact. Use `[NullString]::Value` and test appending a second case while preserving
the first. The owner's interrupted promotion was recovered from its validated
temporary index with both recordings rechecked. No original evidence was changed.
[Crash capture follow-through](reviews/2026-09-15-crash-capture.md).

### KI-34 — Offline analysis mistakes post-reset ground contact for a landing

**Developer analysis; reproduced/fixed 2026-09-15.** In the crash baseline, a
teleport at force row 2045 placed the car briefly airborne; row 2054 was then
reported as a landing candidate. The analyzer cleared prior history but armed
again without observing ground contact after the reset. Require that contact
before an airborne transition can qualify. Spawn/reset regressions now cover
this case. Shipping landing detection is unchanged and already has ground arming.
[Evidence](reviews/2026-09-15-crash-capture.md).

### KI-33 — Installer entry points and removal prerequisites

**Tooling; fixed in source after 0.2.5, not yet in a published ZIP.** Uninstall
required UMM even after it had already been removed. Batch launchers dropped
custom `GameDir` arguments and could conceal errors after their final pause.
Wildcard path checks failed for literal game folders containing square brackets.
Launching through PowerShell 7 could also inherit an incompatible module path.

The revised launchers preserve arguments/status and initialize Windows
PowerShell's own modules. Removal no longer needs UMM; game paths use literal
checks. Incomplete downloads and copy failures have actionable instructions.
The isolated `Test-Installer.ps1` suite exercises the actual batch/PowerShell
entry points, settings-preserving install/upgrade/removal and failure/retry.
Published 0.2.5 archives remain unchanged. The installer is not transactional:
a mid-copy failure requires a successful full retry before launching the game.

### KI-31 — First saved Unity capture fails exact offline integer replay

**Resolved in development tooling, 2026-09-11; original observation below.**
The isolated actual-Mono runner matches all 8,974 commands. Replay now checks
recorded-float conversion exactly with an explicit runtime contract, preserves
the original arithmetic tolerance, and still rejects one-unit command edits.
The unchanged capture is promoted to `results/regression-corpus/index.json`.

**Original RC5 finding:**
Strict .NET 8 replay expects 4,124 at force row 5,892, but the observed native
command is 4,123. It is the only integer mismatch among 8,974 rows. All capture
hashes/counts and motion alignment checks pass; force delivery rejected no calls.
Frozen legacy and toolkit arithmetic agree exactly offline, with at most
1.1920929e-7 float difference from the recording.

The recorded float 0.4123999774456024 multiplied by 10,000 at double precision
truncates to 4,123; rounding the product to single precision first yields 4,124.
Double-product conversion of recorded outputs matches every observed integer.
Actual Mono now confirms this conversion contract. No tolerance was relaxed or
force tune changed. [Original evidence and landing analysis](reviews/2026-09-10-first-jump-capture.md).


### KI-26 — Developer recorder reports ready but its control pipe never opens

**Reproduced in Unity; corrected in developer probe 0.2.5.1.** The first
attended RC5 capture attempt on 2026-09-10 local time timed out on STATUS.
Unity 2019's Mono implements `WindowsIdentity.User` by throwing
`NotImplementedException`; a background catch/retry concealed the startup failure.
Its asynchronous pipe implementation also sets nonblocking pipe mode while the
probe uses synchronous connection waits.

The probe now obtains the same current-user SID from the Windows process token,
retains the user-restricted pipe ACL, uses a blocking pipe on its dedicated
thread, and opens the first pipe before reporting ready. Startup failures reach
the existing load error/unpatch path. CLR checks cover SID equivalence, failed
startup and external commands. After the owner quit normally, the fixed probe
loaded in Unity and STATUS/START succeeded; both frame and force counts increased
without an incomplete flag. That run then exposed KI-27 on menu quit; no detailed
drive capture was saved. No shipping mod or toolkit change was required.
See [the capture session](reviews/2026-09-10-attended-rc5.md).

### KI-20 — State polling constructs game managers and floods ghost downloads

**Major; fixed in 0.2.4, RC5 owner retest accepted 2026-09-09 UTC.** Owner
RC4 testing was good overall but had a strong stutter around a curve near a crowd,
roughly a minute into one stage. The session's Player.log contains 43,806 failed
EventManager initializations in MainMenu, 4,981 uncaught ghost-callback exceptions
and 23,468 connection failures. Download callbacks continued during force traces.

Our `GameState` predicates called `GameEntryPoint.EventManager`, a lazy factory.
When no instance exists in a menu, construction fails after queuing a ghost
download; catching the exception does not undo the request. The next frame tries
again. The same getter is in 0.2.3; RC4's diagnostics added another state read.

Read the verified private `eventManager` field instead, caching only its metadata,
not the stage instance. Input and support helpers use the same passive read;
missing-manager input remains untouched. A regression first reproduced 4,000
lazy getter calls/requests from 1,000 polls, then zero after the fix. Tests also
exercise the actual game's private field and stage/ownership transitions without
calling Unity constructors. No game factory or leaderboard behavior is patched.

This is a strong stutter suspect, not a proven attribution of the crowd-side hitch.
RC4's stutter case remains failed historical evidence. The owner's RC5 drive was
accepted for release; its 197,466-byte Unity log has one normal initialization and
zero constructor errors, connection failures or exceptions. This resolves the
observed error flood, without assigning every crowd-side or T300 hitch this cause.
The full attended matrix remains incomplete.
See [the log review](reviews/2026-09-09-rc4-stutter.md) for exact counts and limits.


Kept because each one cost real time to find, and because a regression in any of
them would otherwise look like a new mystery.

## Upstream, recorded here

This is a historical record of the shared-model investigation. Version 0.2.5 consumes the versioned `AxleForceCurve@1` compatibility pipeline from
toolkit v0.13.0; the generic ForceModel/SimLite pipeline remains unused.

### U-1 — `simlite@1` was not art of rally's tuning; `simlite@2` is

dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit's `simlite@1` profile was described as this mod's 0.2.2
tuning. Feeding it `docs/force-curve-vector.csv` (2026-09-04) showed that only
its **model** half was: its **shaper** half was the toolkit's own `ForceShaper`
defaults, which this game does not use. Our curve has no deadzone, no output
deadband, no soft saturation, no slew limit and no ramp — 500 N at 5 km/h
produces 0.005487 undiminished and sends 54 to the wheel, not 0.

Fixed upstream as `simlite@2`. `simlite@1` was annotated rather than edited, so a
published version stays immutable.

**Consequence for us:** if the toolkit's `ForceModel` is ever adopted here
([ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) step 3), take **`ForceProfile.SimLite()`** — from
toolkit 0.7.1, an in-code literal returning the model and its conditioning
together. Not `ForceModelSettings.SimLite()`, which is half a tune; it now
derives from the profile and its doc comment says so, but pairing it with a
default `ForceShaper` reproduces exactly this defect.

Fixed structurally in 0.7.1, which matters more than the value fix: every value
in a preset is now **stated rather than inherited**, so a changed default cannot
quietly retune one, and a drift test pins each preset to the section it names in
the profiles file key by key. `arcade` had the same defect from the other side —
its conditioning wants soft saturation 1.0 and a slew limit of 3.6, neither of
them `ForceShaper` defaults — so the bug was in the pattern, not in one preset.

Read the shaper values before assuming what adoption costs: `simlite@2` sets
`Deadzone` 0, `SoftSaturation` 0, `SlewPerSecond` 0, `OutputDeadband` 0,
`RampSeconds` 0 and `AttackSmoothing` = `DecaySmoothing` = 0.2. It is
**equal on the unsmoothed grid**, not dynamically equivalent. The 2026-09-06
consumer regression against the pinned DLL demonstrates a clamp/EMA difference
even at constant speed: 0.80 then 0.16 here versus 1.00 then 0.32 upstream for
23,000 N then zero at 40 km/h. See ROADMAP.md before adoption.

### U-2 — Clamp order: resolved, the toolkit adopted ours

We fade then clamp; `ForceModel.Compute` used to clamp then fade. Four of 640
vector rows differed, all at 5–7.5 km/h, worst 1,086/10,000 at the wheel. Detail
and the table are in
[FORCE-FEEDBACK.md](FORCE-FEEDBACK.md#toolkit-conformance-static-and-dynamic-evidence).

**Aligned to our order in toolkit v0.7.0** (2026-09-04), on the reasoning that a
device limit applied before a model term stops being a boundary constraint and
becomes a silent soft knee. At that time nothing in production moved: no consumer referenced
`Dbce.Wheel.Ffb`, and OutRun — the only user of the shared model, through the C++
port — defaults to its own legacy model and its profiles have no fade.

Two things came out of building it that are worth knowing here:

- **The bigger casualty was soft saturation, not the fade.** `ForceShaper`'s
  `tanh` was receiving an already-clamped value, so everything from full scale
  upward arrived as exactly 1.0 and there was nothing left to compress — a hard
  clip where a profile had asked for a soft knee. A model output of 1.5 reached
  the wheel as 7,615/10,000, identical to what 1.0 produced; it now reaches
  9,051. **This does not reach us**, at step 3 or otherwise: `simlite@2` sets
  `SoftSaturation` to 0, so the stage is inert for our tune. It matters to
  `arcade-outrun@1`, which asks for 1.0 precisely so a crash outweighs a hard
  corner. A note here previously said adopting the shaper would bring us a soft
  knee to judge at the wheel; it would not.
- **The conformance sequence could not see the change.** Applying it produced a
  zero-line golden diff, because the sequence never drove the model past full
  scale. A record that cannot see the class of change it is recording is worse
  than no record. Ours has the same shape of risk: `force-curve-vector.csv`
  covers saturation because the grid deliberately includes 14,000 N, but any
  future addition to `ForceCurve` needs its own straddling rows or the CSV will
  keep passing while proving nothing.

  It happened a third time in toolkit 0.8.0: every shipped profile used strength
  50, where gain is exactly 1.0 and a gain *reordering* is unobservable, so a
  chain reshuffle that fixed two severe defects would have produced another
  zero-line diff. The general rule, better than the way it was first written
  down here: **a conformance set must contain a case where every parameter that
  can change behaviour is off its default.** Strength 50 and smoothing 0 are
  defaults hiding in plain sight — and our own vector uses gain 1.0 throughout,
  for exactly the reason it nearly missed saturation.

### U-3 — The low-speed fade scales the force, it does not cap it

Inherent to fade-then-clamp, not to anyone's implementation, and true of this
mod since 0.2.1. The fade multiplies; a large enough force simply overwhelms it
and reaches full output at walking pace, where a clamp applied earlier would have
limited it by accident.

Front lateral force (both wheels, trail 1.0) needed to reach **full** output:

| km/h | fade | Strength 15 | Strength 26 | Strength 50 | Strength 100 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 5 | 0.126 | 303,750 N | 175,240 N | 91,125 N | 45,563 N |
| 7.5 | 0.500 | 76,667 N | 44,231 N | 23,000 N | 11,500 N |
| 10 | 0.874 | 43,870 N | 25,309 N | 13,161 N | 6,580 N |

Against a **measured hard-cornering peak of about 8,800 N** total. Inside the
fade band proper (3–8 km/h) the threshold is 5× to 35× anything the game has been
seen to produce, so at the strengths people actually run — 15 and 26 in the two
reports we have — this is unreachable. It is not a present defect.

It becomes live in one specific future: **impact and kerb effects**
([ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)). An impact spike is exactly the kind of transient that
can be several times cornering `Fy`, and it happens at any speed. If those are
added, the fade must not be relied on as the thing that keeps a low-speed
collision from slamming the wheel — that needs its own limit.


## Will not fix

### WNF-1 — Switching Rewired's input backend at runtime

**Four attempts over two days, 2026-09-01 to 2026-09-03. Do not try a fifth.**

`ReInput.configuration.windowsStandalonePrimaryInputSource` has a runtime
setter that calls Rewired's `ResetAll()`. Applied at mod load it killed the
keyboard with no in-game way back. Applied after the title screen it killed the
**menus** while every probe said input was flowing — 67 keypresses seen by
Unity, by Rewired's keyboard controller and by the player's actions
(`UISubmit`, `UICancel`, `UIHorizontal` all firing), keyboard maps enabled and
identical, the UI input module alive with player 0.

The game logged 48,216 "object created by a previous session … no longer valid"
errors from Rewired objects cached by `ControllerButtonDisplay` and `Arcader`;
refreshing all 84 references brought that to zero and the menus stayed dead.
The cause was never found.

Devices Rewired cannot read are handled by `WheelInput`, which bypasses it
entirely and works. The switch survives only as `UseDirectInputBackend` in
Settings.xml, deliberately absent from the panel. Full account in
[CONTROLS.md](CONTROLS.md).

### WNF-2 — Cockpit view

art of rally's cars have no modelled interiors — no dashboard, wheel, pillars
or wipers — and the world is authored for a distant isometric camera, so at eye
level you get LOD pop-in and shadow cascades tuned for tens of metres away. A
cockpit view is not a camera change, it is an art project. Bonnet and bumper
mounts deliver what matters for driving feel. See [CAMERA.md](CAMERA.md).

### WNF-3 — Routing the wheel through xoutput / XInput

It would break force feedback rather than help it: axis resolution drops to
gamepad precision, separate pedal axes collapse into triggers, and **XInput has
no force feedback beyond rumble**. The entire FFB path here is DirectInput, and
a virtual pad hides the real device from exactly the API it needs. A virtual
controller left running can also steal the force-feedback slot from the real
wheel — see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### WNF-4 — Physics, grip or assist changes

art of rally has online leaderboards. Force feedback, cameras and telemetry are
fair-play neutral; grip, assists and car behaviour are not. Keeping that line
bright is what lets the mod be shared without argument. `DisableSteerAssist`
does change driving aids, which is why it is off by default and labelled.
