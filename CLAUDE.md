## Repository Purpose

Turn art of rally into a sim rig game: force feedback, Forza-compatible UDP
telemetry, bonnet camera. The game's physics are already a real load-sensitive
tire model; this project connects that simulation to a wheel, a dashboard and a
viewpoint.

The founding discovery: **art of rally ships a complete force feedback
implementation that never runs, because `UnityForceFeedback.dll` was left out of
the build.** The managed `ForceFeedback` class P/Invokes seven entry points from
a module that does not exist in the install. The clean-room implementation of
it now lives in dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit as `WheelFfb.dll`, vendored here and
shipped under the name the game's dead code P/Invokes.

Unlike the sibling `dbce-mod-toolkit` (private by design), this is intended to
be **public and shareable**. Keep it that way: no game assemblies committed, no
third-party binaries, nothing that would force the repo private.

## Repository Structure

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/ArtOfSimRally.Mod/` | The whole mod. One project, one assembly. `Main.cs` is the only loader-aware file. |
| `lib/toolkit/` | **Vendored** from dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit (pinned by `VERSION`; refresh with `tools/Sync-Toolkit.ps1`): `native/WheelFfb.dll` (shipped as `UnityForceFeedback.dll`, the name the mod P/Invokes) and `dotnet/Dbce.Wheel.Ffb.dll` / `Dbce.Wheel.Telemetry.dll`. The native source and the encoder live in that repo now. **These binaries are committed** — see the gitignore note under Findings. |
| `lib/umm/` | UnityModManager.dll + 0Harmony.dll, extracted locally, **never committed**. |
| `tests/` | Executable consumer regression, CameraTuning, WheelInput/Shifter, ForceLifecycle, GameState, lifecycle, telemetry, Signals, Support, recorder and hook suites; Python replay/evidence tests. Run through `tools/testing/Test-Rc.ps1`. |
| `tools/` | `Sync-Toolkit.ps1` (toolkit pin), `package/` (release zip), `installer/` (the double-click installer), `dinput-enum/` (lists DirectInput devices without launching the game). |
| `docs/OVERNIGHT-QUEUE.md` / `docs/USER-FEEDBACK.md` | Prioritized follow-up work, user reports and unsent support drafts. |
| `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md` | **The defect register.** Open, resolved and will-not-fix, with severities. Read before diagnosing anything. |
| `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | User-facing fixes by symptom; the Fanatec section is the most-needed page. |
| `docs/DEVELOPMENT-CAPTURE.md` | Separate probe schema, motion/contact units, standalone analysis and interpretation limits. |
| `docs/` | FINDINGS, FORCE-FEEDBACK, TELEMETRY, CONTROLS, CAMERA, ROADMAP, RELEASING |

## Status (2026-10-04)

Owner-accepted on 2026-10-01 (MOZA R12, three 2560×1440 panels in Surround): wheel 0.2.7,
FFB, telemetry and triple screens 0.3.12. art of rally is close to done.

**0.4.0 (branch `claude/unified-mod`)** merges the triple-screen mod (history imported from
the archived `dbce-triple-mod-art-of-rally`) into this one:
`src/ArtOfSimRally.Mod/Triple/` (game-side rendering, the accepted 0.3.12 code),
`src/Dbce.TripleScreen.Core` (projection math), `src/Dbce.TripleScreen.Protocol` (optimizer
layout/status contract), `tests/TripleScreen` (66 geometry assertions), `docs/triple/`.
`Triple/TripleScreen.cs` is driven from `Main.cs` and drawn on the Cameras page; its
settings live in `TripleScreen.xml` (XML root `<Settings>`, so the old file loads as-is).
Codex's later triple commit f8b0f81 (FOV/handoff refactor, never driven) is in history but
**not** in the build. All 17 offline gates pass; it's waiting for a drive at the rig.

Follow-ups: the triple-screen optimizer still looks for `Mods/DbceTripleScreenArtOfRally`
for its status view; `Dbce.TripleScreen.Core` here is older than the triple toolkit's (no
bezel gap); the Triple card uses plain IMGUI, not the panel's card styling; adopt the
portfolio numpad camera layout; build a recorded session for automated tests.

Older status notes and the component table below are from 2026-09-09 (Codex era); trust
the code and the 2026-10-01 acceptance over them.

## Earlier status (2026-09-09)

Published stable remains **0.2.4**. Current development is **0.2.5**: strict USB
axis/shifter identity and idle reader recovery (KI-21/KI-23), last-session
diagnostic retention (KI-19), stale-force release (KI-22), deferred binding edits
(KI-24), and idle telemetry connection/disable handling (KI-25). All have offline
coverage; new candidate hardware testing remains pending. See
`docs/reviews/2026-09-09-overnight-025.md` and `docs/LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md` for the
exact validated/installed artifact, hashes and receipts. The Stream Deck Steam
550320 button targets that installation. Toolkit **v0.12.0**, native **0.5.0**
remain unchanged: shared wrapper, AxleForceCurve@1 and telemetry are consumed in
production. No force tune, new wheel effects, physics or assist changes.

The separate developer probe now records schema-3 motion/contact/suspension
context, with standalone event/force analysis and schema-1/2 compatibility. It
is not shipped or automatically installed. No real capture has been completed;
signal freshness and runtime overhead still need an attended drive. Read
`docs/DEVELOPMENT-CAPTURE.md` before interpreting landing/slide candidates.

Stable 0.2.4 was released after owner RC5 acceptance. Its preserved drive log
has one normal manager initialization and zero initialization errors, connection
failures or exceptions. KI-20's error flood is resolved on this rig; the T300
user's unrelated slowdown remains unconfirmed. The full attended matrix,
motion/shaker comparison and TSS/Fanatec/combined-camera-mod checks remain pending.
Owner acceptance does not mark those cases passed. Published evidence is in
`docs/reviews/2026-09-09-release-0.2.4.md`. "Verified" means confirmed on the
owner's MOZA R12 rig unless stated otherwise.

| Component | State |
|---|---|
| Force feedback | Verified. Front-axle lateral force × pneumatic trail (reference 11,500 N after two retunes), faded out below 12 km/h, re-acquires the wheel after alt-tab. Sign confirmed on a MOZA R12; the MOZA R5 one-sided inversion fixed by user report. |
| Steering fixes, bind-any-device, glyph text fallback | Verified. |
| Shifter (sequential + H-pattern), read directly from the device | Verified by users. |
| Bonnet + bumper cameras | Owner RC6 camera smoke passed; offline handback tests pass. The complete stock/replay/finish transition matrix remains pending. Issue #1 reporter separately says unplugging a PS5 pad resolved their symptom (KI-1/KI-2). |
| Telemetry (Forza format) | Previously verified live with SimHub + ButtKicker. KI-16 units/local-axis corrections now pass offline/encoded UDP tests; changed motion/shaker response requires an attended comparison. |
| **Direct wheel input** (`WheelInput`) | Verified driving on the owner's rig 2026-09-03 after the steering-sign fix (assignment is direction-independent; Flip per channel). Released in 0.2.2. Fanatec user pending. |
| Crash fix (shifter choice after FFB failure), FFB candidate fallback, capability labels | Released in 0.2.2; init verified here, Fanatec user pending. |
| Rewired DirectInput backend switch (`InputBackend`) | **Abandoned** after four attempts. Settings.xml-only experiment. Do not retry — see below. |
| Toolkit adoption | Managed wrapper and AxleForceCurve@1 adopted; new explicit FFB selections persist strict GUIDs. Offline tests and local Mono loading/drive pass; full hardware lifecycle matrix pending. Damper/periodic effects remain unused. |

The game's force feedback was half-built: `ForceFeedback` is never attached,
`Wheel.Mz` is computed only `if (cardynamics.enableForceFeedback)`, which
nothing sets, and `CarDynamics.forceFeedback` is never assigned. The mod sets
the flag, computes a force from the steered axle and drives the DLL. The force
is **not** `Mz` any more — see "Findings" below and docs/FORCE-FEEDBACK.md.

## Conventions

- **The telemetry encoder and native FFB layer are not in this repo.** They are
  vendored built artifacts from dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit under `lib/toolkit`. Fix
  FFB lifecycle or packet-layout bugs *there*, release, then bump the pin here
  with `tools/Sync-Toolkit.ps1 -Version vX.Y.Z`. Game-specific code (hooks,
  force signal, cameras, panel) stays here.

- **Solution stays classic `.sln`**, not `.slnx`. The .NET 10 SDK emits `.slnx`
  by default and older SDKs cannot open it. Regenerate with
  `dotnet new sln --format sln`.
- The native DLL is **x64 only**. A 32-bit build fails to load with no
  diagnostic beyond force feedback silently not working.
- `BOOL` in the native plugin is the 4-byte Win32 `BOOL`, never C++ `bool` —
  P/Invoke marshals a C# `bool` return as 4 bytes.
- Dates in YYYY-MM-DD.

## Non-negotiable design rules

1. **No physics or assist changes.** art of rally has online leaderboards.
   Force feedback, camera and telemetry are fair-play neutral; grip, assists and
   car behaviour are not. This is what lets the mod be shared without argument.
2. **Never commit game assemblies or `.CT` files.** Reference the local Steam
   install. This repo must stay publishable.
3. **Bonnet camera, not cockpit.** The cars have no modelled interiors. This is
   a settled decision, not a gap — see `docs/CAMERA.md`.
4. **Do not guess wire-format offsets.** The Forza layout is anchored on
   `Speed`@256 and `Gear`@319, both validated against SimHub via the sibling
   cruisn-collection harness. A wrong offset does not throw, it renders a
   plausible and completely wrong dashboard. The tests that lock this down now
   live in dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit with the encoder; keep them there.
5. **Never switch Rewired's input source at runtime in shipped code.** The
   setter calls `ResetAll()`; applied at load it killed the keyboard, applied
   after the title screen it killed the menus while every probe said input was
   flowing. Four attempts over two days (docs/CONTROLS.md). Devices Rewired
   cannot read are handled by `WheelInput`, which bypasses it.
6. **One DirectInput instance per session in the native plugin.** Releasing a
   "temporary" instance while the device table stayed populated crashed the
   game for a Fanatec user. `EnsureDirectInput()` at every entry point;
   `FreeDirectInput` releases the instance only when nothing else holds a device.
7. **Deploy only when the game is closed.** The DLLs are locked while it runs;
   a copy that "succeeds" over a running game is the stale build you tested last.
8. **The vendored toolkit binaries are committed, and must stay committed.**
   They are our own MIT artifacts, not third-party ones, so they do not
   compromise rule 2. Without them a clone cannot package. Verify with
   `git check-ignore -v lib/toolkit/native/WheelFfb.dll` returning nothing.

## Environment facts

- art of rally: app id **550320**, build **17584229**, installed at
  `D:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\artofrally`. Steam root on this
  machine is on `D:`, not a default path.
- Engine: **Unity 2019.4.38f1, Mono** — ideal for modding. Not IL2CPP.
- Input: **Rewired 1.1.55 on the Raw Input backend.** The game has its own
  press-to-bind screen (`ControlsRemapper`) which only ever binds `Joysticks[0]`
  (the mod retargets it to the device you touch). Unrecognised wheels bind but
  get a hidden 10% deadzone (mod removes it). Some devices Raw Input cannot
  read at all — a Fanatec direct-drive base appears twice as `FANATEC Wheel`,
  32 axes / 144 buttons, no element ever moves; DirectInput reads the same two
  as 8/108 and 12/63 and only one has the actuator. For those: direct wheel
  input. **xoutput/XInput must NOT be used** — it hides the wheel from the
  DirectInput API force feedback needs. See docs/CONTROLS.md.
- Logs: UMM `artofrally_Data\Managed\UnityModManager\Log.txt`; native
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ArtOfSimRally\ffb.log`; Unity
  `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Funselektor Labs\art of rally\Player.log`
  — Rewired's own errors appear only there, without stack traces.
- The game runs on the **second monitor**; a primary-screen screenshot will not
  show it.
- Bindings persist in PlayerPrefs at `HKCU\Software\Funselektor Labs\art of rally`.
  That key not existing means the game has never been launched on this machine.
- **There is no native build in this repo any more.** The native source moved to
  dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit; build it there and re-pin here. MSVC 14.44 x64 build
  tools and Windows SDK 10.0.26100 with `dinput8.lib` are installed for that
  repo's sake, and `dumpbin.exe` (useful for checking a new pin's exports) is at
  `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.44.35207\bin\Hostx64\x64\`.
  `cl.exe` is not on PATH.
- The native DLL logs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ArtOfSimRally\ffb.log` **by default** —
  logging is on unless `DBCE_FFB_LOG=0`. The old `AOSR_FFB_LOG=1` variable no
  longer exists; anything still telling you to set it is stale.
- `vcvars64.bat` prints `'vswhere.exe' is not recognized` on this machine. That
  comes from inside Microsoft's script and is harmless; only a non-zero exit
  code means a real failure.

## Findings that must not be re-derived

- **`GameEntryPoint.EventManager` is a lazy factory.** Do not call it from mod
  state polling, input or support. Failed menu construction queues ghost replay
  downloads before throwing; catching does not undo the work. RC4 produced
  43,806 failures and a download backlog continuing into driving. Read the existing
  private `eventManager` field via `GameState.ExistingManager`; cache metadata,
  never a manager across scene teardown. KI-20 fixes the code; owner RC5 retest accepted and error flood absent.
- **`Mz` is unusable as a steering force.** `CalcAligningForce` is a 1989
  Pacejka curve that reverses sign at ~8° slip; this game's front tyres run
  12–29° in ordinary corners, so the wheel flipped from centring to pushing
  outward mid-corner ("there is no centre"). Force = `(FyL + FyR) × trail /
  FyReference`, trail 1.0 → 0.6 at twice the ideal slip angle, faded 3→12 km/h.
  `+Fy` centres on a MOZA R12. Measured 2026-09-02 with the `FFB trace` lines
  (DiagnosticLogging).
- **`0x80040205` is `DIERR_NOTEXCLUSIVEACQUIRED`**, not INCOMPLETEEFFECT or
  EFFECTPLAYING (both were tried). It means focus was lost and the wheel came
  back non-exclusive; the DLL re-acquires and retries. Look up HRESULTs in the
  SDK's `dinput.h` before theorising.
- **Telemetry `IsRaceOn` is true from `WAITING_TO_BEGIN`**, so a shaker follows
  the engine while revving on the line. Forces still wait for `UNDERWAY`.
- **A `.gitignore` rule excluding a directory cannot be undone below it.**
  `lib/` plus `!lib/toolkit/**` silently kept the vendored toolkit untracked
  through all of 0.2.2 — git never descends into an excluded directory, so the
  re-include never matched. `lib/*` is the fix. Check with `git check-ignore -v`,
  not by reading the file.
- **The Fanatec crash chain** (support bundle 2026-09-03): preferred FFB device
  had no actuator → `CreateEffect` 0x80040154 → instance released → device list
  refilled by a temporary instance → shifter chosen → `CreateDevice` on null.
  Fixed by rule 6 above and by trying every FFB candidate.
- **Rewired reset diagnostics**, for the record: after `ResetAll()` the keyboard
  controller, player actions and UI module all reported input; the game logged
  48,216 "object from a previous session" errors from cached Rewired objects in
  `ControllerButtonDisplay` and `Arcader`; refreshing all 84 references brought
  that to zero and the menus stayed dead. Cause not found. Not worth a fifth try.

## Working on this machine

- **`Stop-Process` from a Bash-spawned PowerShell does not stop the game**; the
  native PowerShell tool does. Same for anything that needs the interactive
  desktop.
- **art of rally no longer accepts injected keyboard input** (retested
  2026-09-04, build 17584229 with UMM). Virtual-key `SendInput`, scan-code
  `SendInput` (`KEYEVENTF_SCANCODE`) and `PostMessage(WM_KEYDOWN)` all leave the
  title screen sitting on "press any button to start", with the game confirmed
  foreground. An earlier note here said the opposite; it no longer holds, so
  **anything needing a stage driven has to be driven by a person.** Plan for
  that: ship a diagnostic behind `DiagnosticLogging` and read the log, rather
  than trying to automate the UI. If retrying anyway: the x64 `INPUT` struct
  must be 40 bytes (`FieldOffset(32) long pad`) or `SendInput` fails with error
  87, `FindWindow` by title fails so use `MainWindowHandle`, and UMM's panel
  opens over the game at startup (`ShowOnStart` in
  `artofrally_Data\Managed\UnityModManager\Params.xml`).
- **The stage camera is a two-object rig.** `CarCameras` is on the GameObject
  "Stage Camera"; the camera that renders is "Camera Main", **its child**, which
  the game pins at local identity (`CameraManager`'s constructor zeroes
  `localPosition`/`localRotation`). Writing a world-space transform to
  `Camera.main` therefore leaves a local offset on the child that the stock rig
  never clears — a code defect relevant to KI-1, not a confirmed diagnosis of its reporter. Anything touching the camera must restore
  that invariant when it lets go.
- `ilspycmd` (dotnet tool) is installed: `ilspycmd -t <Type> Assembly-CSharp.dll`
  for one type, `-p -o <dir>` for the whole assembly. `Rewired_Core.dll` is
  obfuscated internally but its public API decompiles fine.
- Long heredocs in the Bash tool get mangled (quotes, backslashes, truncation).
  Write scripts to the scratchpad with the Write tool and run them by path.
- Support bundles from users are the fastest diagnosis: the controllers section
  shows Rewired's view, the ffb.log section shows DirectInput's. Compare them.

## Testing

**Keep the installed copy current without asking again** (standing owner request,
2026-09-09 UTC). Local deployment is a checklist item when finishing a feature or
bug fix. After its artifact passes all local automated gates, deploy the exact
package if the game is closed, preserving settings and a backup. If the game is
running, record deployment as pending and resume at the next active work session;
never close it or schedule polling. Follow docs/LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md. Scheduled
deployment checks are disabled at the owner's request. This authorization does
not grant public publication or attended sign-off.

**Release builds run locally** (owner preference, 2026-09-08). Run the local RC
or final gate, then upload the exact validated ZIP and checksum using `gh release`
when publication is authorized. Do not add or dispatch GitHub Actions builds
unless the owner changes this preference. No Actions workflows were present when
checked. Tag the artifact's recorded source commit and preserve its hashes;
local publishing does not waive attended checks. See docs/RELEASING.md.

Use `tools/testing/Test-Rc.ps1 -Version 0.2.5-rc.N` with a new RC number, or
`-Version X.Y.Z -Final` for a final-labelled artifact; neither grants runtime sign-off.
It explicitly runs consumer arithmetic, save, camera/lifecycle and capture tests,
package/installer checks, and creates an attended checklist. `dotnet test
ArtOfSimRally.sln` still runs nothing and is not evidence. Game/UMM references
are local and never packaged. Native and encoder source tests stay upstream.

Recorder/playback are **development-only**, never shipping features. Capture is
the separately installed `tools/testing/Recorder` UMM probe; external commands
control it and `tools/testing/Replay` works without game/Unity/wheel dependencies.
Packaging rejects recorder types/dependencies. Use `-Corpus <index.json>` on the
RC runner once real captures exist. Synthetic fixtures are not playthrough evidence. Schema 3 adds aligned motion/contact
context; schemas 1/2 remain readable. No physical wheel-motion or calibrated
impact signal is implied by an offline event candidate.

The release requires the **exact packaged artifact** installed with the game
closed and tested by a person. Automated capture replay evaluates force arithmetic
without native hardware output; it does not recreate Unity or drive a stage.
Do not mark camera, stutter or hardware fixes verified based on offline tests.

```powershell
dotnet build ArtOfSimRally.sln -c Release -warnaserror
```

End-to-end telemetry check, no game required — run the probe in one shell and
the synth in another:

```bash
python E:\Source\dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit\tools\forza\forza_probe.py 8123
```
```powershell
python E:\Source\dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit\tools\forza\forza_synth.py 8123
```

The probe's `src` column reads `mod` when byte 323 carries our `'R'` sentinel,
which distinguishes our packets from anything else already on that port.

## Reading the game's assemblies

No decompiler is needed and nothing needs downloading. Type, field and method
names plus the whole P/Invoke table are readable from metadata with
`System.Reflection.Metadata`, which ships in the .NET SDK. `PEReader` →
`GetMetadataReader()` → enumerate `TypeDefinitions`; `MethodDefinition.GetImport()`
gives the `DllImport` module and entry point. That is how the missing DLL was
found. Method *bodies* need a decompiler: `ilspycmd` is installed and used for that (see above).
