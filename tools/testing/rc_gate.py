Adjust a mount, switch to stock, pause and restart to verify saved edits. Repeat with PS5 controller attached and absent when available; inspect ChangeCamera binding.",

    "input-persistence": "Learn steering and all bound pedal ranges, use clutch/handbrake/shifter, pause, quit, relaunch. Check handbrake rest/partial/full/release using live values. Verify Flip and double Flip for pedal and steering, including restart. Check reader reconnect returns neutral until valid input arrives. Verify bindings/ranges and Strength/Smoothing persist, menus work. Select the wheel explicitly, restart, and verify its saved GUID still identifies it; a missing saved wheel must not choose another.",

CASES["camera"] += " In a separate launch with Nexus CameraMod loaded, verify its chase views/editor and the mounted-view compatibility notice; our mounts should resume in a fresh launch without it."
CASES["stutter"] += " Include rare later-stage slowdowns separately from cold-start hitches; compare detailed logging off/on if needed and retain the candidate's aggregate frame-health report."
CASES["stutter"] += " Before driving, wait 30 seconds in the main menu and inspect Player.log for repeated EventManager construction or ghost-download errors. Drive the same stage/curve as the RC4 report, then return to the menu and repeat; collect support while paused before quitting."
CASES["telemetry"] += " Compare corrected suspension meters/normalized ratios and local axes with the previous build; inspect dashboard/recorded values before motion output. Check pause/restart produces no acceleration spike, then complete an attended shaker/motion comparison."
CASES["support-identity"] += " Collect while paused immediately after a short diagnostic run; inspect loaded mods, cached input values, frame counts and explicit log-window truncation."
CASES["input-persistence"] += " For 0.2.5, check axis and separate-shifter GUID identity after USB enumeration changes; missing identities must not substitute another device. Reconnect while paused with another reader open, allow five seconds; Assign discovers new devices. Resume an unfinished assignment and confirm it cancels."
CASES["support-identity"] += " After a diagnostic drive and normal quit/relaunch, verify previous-session counters retain their original build and timestamps, separate from current counters."
CASES["telemetry"] += " Verify 0.2.5 connections prepare while idle; a driving destination edit keeps the old endpoint until pause. Disabling telemetry must immediately park the consumer; re-enable while paused."
CASES["ffb-lifecycle"] += " Repeat launches including focus changes during startup; verify acquisition recovers. Test normal Quit and Alt+F4 with the developer probe removed. For landing effects: drive the same jump with Landing vibration off, then enabled at strength 5 while paused. Confirm one short vibration on touchdown, unchanged steering between jumps, and no triggers on ordinary contact jitter/restarts/replay. Pause/alt-tab/disable during or just after a landing; vibration must stop. Inspect driver-acceptance counters and save support. Do not pass landing feel from offline replay."
CASES["input-persistence"] += " Verify Landing vibration and its independent strength persist. Increase/decrease UMM font scale; explanations, headings and status text should scale and wrap legibly."
CASES["ffb-lifecycle"] += " For 0.2.6, compare Crash kick off/on: one head-on impact and a light side impact, with braking, a landing and restart as negative controls. Assess the 120 ms constant push/release at a suitable strength (new-settings default50, range0-100), keeping Pit House and steering gains fixed. Compare with standalone method A; neither native API success nor the old sine's accepted requests proved physical feel. Verify no sustained scrape force, one bounded cue during landing/crash overlap, and either feature can be disabled without breaking the other. Inspect driver rejection, playback latency/stop reasons and overlap counters; a rejected constant request must leave ordinary landing available. Save support while paused. With the optional schema-4 probe, STOP while paused and verify collisions.csv before quitting. Physical crash timing/feel cannot pass from offline tests."
CASES["input-persistence"] += " Verify crashes default off, new/missing crash strength defaults50, and saved enable/strength choices survive relaunch without a forced migration. Landing stays default5/range0-40."
