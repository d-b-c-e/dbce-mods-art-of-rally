<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Installs art of sim rally into art of rally.

.DESCRIPTION
    Run from the extracted release folder, normally by double-clicking
    Install.bat next to it.

    Finds the game through the Steam registry rather than guessing at
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam". Steam libraries are routinely on another
    drive, and probing default paths is the single most common way an installer
    reports "game not found" on a perfectly normal machine.

.PARAMETER GameDir
    Skip detection and install here. Use for GOG, Epic, or an unusual layout.

.PARAMETER Uninstall
    Remove the mod instead of installing it.
