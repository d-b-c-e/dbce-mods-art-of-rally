# art of sim rally

Drive [art of rally](https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/) with a racing
wheel, pedals and a shifter. Adds force feedback from the game's tyre forces,
direct USB controls, bonnet/bumper cameras, telemetry for SimHub, and
angle-correct triple screens (one wide display or three separate displays).

**[Download 0.4.1](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/dbce-mods-art-of-rally/releases/tag/v0.4.1)** ·

[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

Version 0.4.1 moves the camera keys to a numpad layout with one step per press, adds a
short rattle to crashes and switches support logging off at each launch. Since 0.4.0 the
triple-screen mod is part of this one; its settings are on the Cameras page. There are five settings pages (Controls, FFB, Cameras, Telemetry and
Help) with Simple and Advanced views. Press **F6** to open Wheel settings. Pause before
changing bindings or devices; the game simulation does not pause automatically.

## Install

For the **64-bit Windows game**. Tested on the Steam version; other stores are
not confirmed. You need the game, your wheel's Windows driver, and Unity Mod
Manager **0.27.0 or newer** (UMM). SimHub is optional. No SDK or separate toolkit
download is needed.

1. **Close the game.** Download and extract
   [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21). Run
   `UnityModManager.exe`, select **Art of Rally**, check its game folder, and click
   **Install**. This is a one-time setup for this game.
2. Download **ArtOfSimRally-0.4.1.zip** from the release's **Assets** section.
   Choose the mod ZIP, not GitHub's **Source code** downloads.
3. Right-click the ZIP → **Extract All**. Open the extracted folder and
   double-click **Install.bat**. Wait for the successful verification message.
4. Launch art of rally through Steam. Press **F6** for Wheel settings, or
   **Ctrl+F10** to open UMM. Check that version **0.4.1** is listed.

The installer finds Steam libraries on other drives and preserves existing mod
settings. If it cannot find your game, see [custom folders](docs/SETUP.md#custom-game-folder).
UMM's [Mods-tab installation](docs/SETUP.md#installing-through-umm) is also supported.

**Updating:** close the game, extract the new ZIP into a fresh folder, and run
its `Install.bat`. No uninstall is needed. **Removing:** close the game and run
`Uninstall.bat` from the extracted download. Your settings and game bindings stay.

## First drive

Pause before assigning controls or selecting devices. Keep the game window
focused while force feedback initializes.

- **Wheel:** in **FFB**, choose **On** and select your real wheel. **Follow steering
  binding** uses a wheel assigned in this mod's Controls page; otherwise choose
  the FFB wheel explicitly. Strength defaults to **50**. Force builds between
  3 and 12 km/h, so test while moving. Advanced has smoothing and direction.
- **Controls:** keep game bindings that work. For a missing axis, centre or
  release it, click **Bind** in Controls, move it through full travel, check the
  preview, then **Save calibration**. Use **Invert** if it reads backwards.
  Menus still use keyboard/pad.
- **Separate USB handbrake or pedals:** bind them on their Controls rows.
  Each row can use a different device; leave working game-controlled rows unbound.
  [TSS handbrake steps](docs/SETUP.md#separate-usb-handbrake).
- **Shifter:** expand **shifter bindings** under Controls, enable **Separate
  shifter**, choose its device and mode, then bind its gears or shift buttons.
- **Landing vibration:** on by default at **5%**, independently of steering
  Strength. Existing saved opt-outs/strengths are kept. Requires wheel sine-effect
  support. This setting controls the wheel; tune a ButtKicker in SimHub.

The mod also removes hidden wheel deadzones and gamepad steering smoothing.
Leave **Disable steering limiter on car spawn (legacy)** off and use the game's
own assist settings.

## Optional cameras and telemetry

**Cameras:** use the game's change-view button to reach bonnet and bumper views.
Adjust the active view with the numpad, or rebind the tuning keys in **Cameras**.
Close the panel to use those keys. [Camera setup](docs/SETUP.md#cameras).
If Nexus Camera Mod is loaded, it keeps control and our mounted views are suspended.

**SimHub:** in **Telemetry**, choose **On** while paused. Use the local preset
**127.0.0.1:8000** on the same PC, and select **Forza Horizon 5** in
SimHub with the same UDP port. No extra SimHub helper is required.
[Dashboard and ButtKicker setup](docs/SETUP.md#simhub-and-buttkicker).

## Getting help

Developers can record and replay drives with the optional SessionTools asset.
See [recording, playback and offline force analysis](docs/SESSION-REPLAY.md).
It is installed separately; ordinary play does not record sessions.

For a recurring problem: enable **Log detail for support**, reproduce briefly,
pause, then use **Help → Create support file**. Turn detail off afterward. Ordinary
errors/settings can be collected without detailed logging.

Attach the Desktop `art-of-sim-rally-support-*.txt` to a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/d-b-c-e/art-of-sim-rally/issues), with your wheel,
driver, stage/car and what happened. See [troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

Tested on the owner's **MOZA R12**, with positive reports from **MOZA R5** and
**Thrustmaster T300 RS GT** users. Fanatec/TSS-specific behavior and the full
hardware transition matrix still need confirmation. Known limits and pending
checks are in [KNOWN-ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md).

## Development

Version 0.2.6 added an experimental [constant-force crash kick](docs/CRASH-EFFECTS.md),
off by default at strength **50** with range **0–100**. Landing stays on by
default at strength **5**, range **0–40**. Saved settings are preserved. Crash
feel varies by hardware; a higher nominal setting does not guarantee spare
wheel headroom. Both effects are separate from SimHub telemetry.

Version 0.2.7 improves USB binding recovery and adds optional shift vibration,
off by default. Fresh T300/TSS binding and physical shift feel still need
feedback; see the [0.2.7 release notes](docs/releases/0.2.7.md).

[Build instructions](docs/BUILDING.md) · [Documentation index](docs/README.md) ·
[Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) · [Release procedure](docs/RELEASING.md)

The native driver, managed FFB wrapper/force curve and telemetry encoder come
from **dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit**. The exact release pin and hashes are recorded
in [Local deployment](docs/LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md). Developer recording/replay tools
are a separate optional release asset, excluded from the normal player ZIP.

## Licence

MIT. No game or UMM assemblies are redistributed. The native force-feedback
plugin is our own DirectInput implementation.
