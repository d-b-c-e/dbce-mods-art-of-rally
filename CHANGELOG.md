# Changelog

Notable changes to art of sim rally.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - unreleased

One mod for art of rally: wheel, FFB, telemetry, cameras and triple screens.

### Changed

- Triple screens, previously the separate "DBCE triple-screen for art of rally"
  mod (last 0.3.12), are now part of this mod. Its settings are on the Cameras
  page under **Triple screens** and are saved in `TripleScreen.xml`. The
  rendering code is the owner-accepted 0.3.12 unchanged.
- The installer copies the old mod's `Settings.xml` and `desired-layout.json`
  across (never overwriting), then moves the old mod folder to
  `Mods-retired` so Unity Mod Manager stops loading it. If the old mod is
  still loaded anyway, triple rendering stays off and the settings page says so.
- Version jumps to 0.4.0, above both previous mods (wheel 0.2.7, triple 0.3.12).

Wheel, FFB, telemetry and camera behavior are unchanged from 0.2.7.

### Optional developer SessionTools

- Replays recorded car trajectories through menus, driving, finish and results;
  isolates kinematic playback from stock physics/reset writers and verifies each
  previous pose on the next physics tick. Input resimulation remains diagnostic.
- New captures retain resolved scene/car/weather choices, sealed background-written
  streams, original force/motion/collision samples and telemetry before output muting.
- Separate offline force trials and unit-labelled statistics preserve original
  captures and owner tuning. Wheel/SimHub output stays muted during playback.
- A shared, separately pinned playback core provides ordering, completion hashes,
  bounded writing and statistics for other game adapters. The player ZIP stays
  independent of this optional probe.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-09-30

Promotes the 0.2.7-rc.2 behavior to the regular release. USB Bind now keeps
healthy readers open, retries failed readers and calibrates the saved axis.
Optional 25 Hz/120 ms shift vibration is off by default, with an independent
5% default and 0–20% range. Steering, crash waveform, landing and telemetry
remain unchanged. The owner's MOZA handbrake rebound successfully; fresh
T300/TSS binding, shift feel and crash response at 50% still need hardware
feedback. All 16 local gates passed on the final-labelled package.

## [0.2.7-rc.2] - 2026-09-30 (prerelease)

### Added

- Optional gear-engagement wheel rumble, off by default at 5% with a 0–20%
  range. It shares the finite sine handle with landing; landing and crash cues
  take priority. Real-wheel feel and timing remain to be tested.

### Fixed

- Routine Bind keeps healthy USB readers open and retries a reader that initially
  failed. Calibrate stays on the saved axis, and Controls shows paused/assigned
  status more clearly. A MOZA handbrake rebound successfully; the T300/TSS
  report still needs a hardware retest.

Crash output, telemetry, steering and the pinned toolkit are unchanged. Existing
saved crash strengths are retained; 50% applies only to new settings.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- FFB and shifter device pickers now use bounded selectors with explicit choice
  markers instead of full-width button stacks. The FFB refresh action is compact;
  a saved but disconnected wheel remains visible without being selectable.
- Clearer candidate binding groups with stronger borders and contrast, bold
  names, owned actions and local calibration instructions; camera keyboard/USB
  bindings share one group. Flat navigation tabs, compact header commands,
  left-aligned guidance with smaller row actions and Show/Hide optional sections
  reduce Simple clutter. The redundant Setup page is removed while old saved
  page choices retain their meaning. Owner tuning and runtime behavior are
  preserved; rendered acceptance of this layout remains pending.

- Compact right-aligned commands replace remaining full-width action bars;
  setting choices stay compact segmented controls and Advanced/Show navigation
  uses flat links. New settings follow UMM's scale by default; Auto remains an
  explicit per-mod alternative.
- Opening the game's bindings screen now waits for the initiating UMM click/key
  to release, then explicitly returns native-menu ownership after two neutral
  frames. Persistent wheel/pedal UI axes can no longer leave that screen animated
  but unable to accept input.

- Candidate settings text follows UMM's scale by default, with an Auto option
  for high-resolution enlargement and preservation of host preferences.
  Content fits the actual host viewport and page buttons wrap on narrower windows.

- Simple/Advanced settings with Controls, FFB, Cameras, Telemetry and Help;
  F6 entry, optional USB Settings/Stop FFB buttons, and F8 stop that retains Off.
- Provisional axis calibration with Save/Cancel, explicit inversion/deadzone,
  separate additive handbrake axis/button, and strict FFB follow-Steering selection.
- Keyboard/USB camera adjustment bindings, scoped camera/FFB resets, atomic
  telemetry connection drafts and a guarded route to the game's binding screen.
- Offline fixtures for presentation/persistence, calibration write failure,
  independent USB devices, reserved-key reset conflicts and settings output gates.

- Support diagnostics count 33/50/100 ms driving intervals separately for the
  first five seconds, next ten seconds and later driving. Prior-session summaries
  retain these counts; old summaries remain readable.
- Last-landing diagnostics compare first contact with suspension compression
  and all-wheel contact, without changing when the vibration starts.
- Experimental wheel crash vibration with its own strength control, off by default.
  It uses body contact direction to distinguish head-on hits from glancing scrapes.
  Landing and crash cues share one bounded finite effect; physical tuning is pending.
- Separate developer probe records body collisions, including relative motion,
  impulse and contact direction, with validated schema-4 replay and legacy capture
  support. This is developer instrumentation, not a new wheel or motion effect.

- Offline telemetry regressions for front/side collision trajectories at multiple
  sample rates and headings, including reset suppression. Crash feedback remains
  under investigation for motion; telemetry signals remain unchanged.

### Changed

- Experimental crash output uses a finite 120ms constant-force push/release,
  default50/range0–100, still opt-in. Landing stays a 25Hz/120ms sine,
  default5/range0–40. Saved values keep their output; one impact owns the slot.
  The prior shaped rebound candidate failed its attended test. Stronger constant
  crash feel remains unaccepted; UI changes do not retune forces or telemetry.
- Shorter install/first-drive README and dedicated setup/build guides, including
  separate USB handbrakes, updates/removal, SimHub and support-file instructions.
- Standalone release readme with usable online links and current 0.2.6 defaults.
- Installer reports the verified release and explains incomplete downloads clearly.

### Fixed

- Keep settings input out of native menus; opening the game's bindings screen
  waits for the initiating control to release. The owner confirmed that route
  works in game. The broader physical-input matrix remains pending.

- Binding saves, clears and shortcut-default restores retain the previous
  effective assignment if Settings.xml cannot be written. Failed calibration
  remains provisional for retry/Cancel; device switches wait for successful save.
- Settings/focus transitions suppress mod driving/force/camera input, and held
  shifter buttons wait for release before reuse. Physical/UI verification pending.
- Slow native impact calls no longer consume the managed burst lifetime.
  Support records call latency and stop reasons to diagnose early interruption.
- Native toolkit stops writing every changing steering-force sample
  to disk by default. Startup, lifecycle and error logs remain available.
  This removes avoidable driving I/O; the reported startup hitch is not yet reproduced.
- Developer analysis no longer reports a landing from an airborne spawn/reset.
- Developer corpus tool can append a second recording without losing the existing index.
- Uninstaller can remove the mod after Unity Mod Manager has been removed.
- Batch launchers forward custom-folder arguments and preserve failure exit codes.
- Batch launchers use Windows PowerShell's own modules when started from PowerShell 7.
- Installer treats game paths containing square brackets literally.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Wheel landing vibration with independent strength: game contact detection and
  finite 120 ms hardware sine bursts. Enabled by default at strength 5; existing
  saved choices are preserved. Steering force and SimHub telemetry stay separate.

- Actual Unity Mono compatibility tests in the local RC gate, recorded-drive
  regression corpus and landing-envelope studies without hardware output.

- Separate developer captures now include contact, suspension and world/local
  motion alongside force. Offline analysis reports landing/slide candidates and
  road context, with legacy capture compatibility and corruption checks. This
  tooling is not installed or shipped with the release mod.
- Retain an opt-in, bounded frame-health summary at idle and normal exit, after
  output release. Support files include the previous session's build, timestamps
  and counters; stale/corrupt snapshots are rejected. This does not capture crash
  traces or identify the cause of a hitch.

### Fixed

- Settings explanations and section headings inherit Mod Manager's current font
  scale. Clarify separate USB handbrake assignment, the shared support-log switch
  and the force-smoothing tradeoff.

- Defer FFB startup until an owned, focused game window is stable; retry failed
  acquisition at most five times while idle, preserving wheel/shifter identity.
- Release force/input and park telemetry before the game's process-killing
  menu Quit, including without the developer probe.
- Developer probe: cancel blocking control-pipe IO and close the worker on
  shutdown; preserve failed saves for retry. Replay now verifies Mono's exact
  float-to-native conversion without changing steering arithmetic or tolerances.

- Developer probe: fix Unity Mono control-pipe startup and intercept the game's
  process-killing Quit action to release outputs/save pending captures first.
  These changes are separate from the shipped mod; automatic quit-save runtime
  validation remains pending.
- Prepare telemetry connections while idle instead of resolving/connecting from
  the physics callback. Destination edits during driving wait for pause, keeping
  the current connection active. Turning telemetry off immediately parks it.
- Clear force/filter state when front-wheel data disappears or the native device
  becomes unavailable, including the game's published force value. Valid driving
  still uses the same shared force curve and tune.
- Resolve separate shifter selections by GUID against a fresh device list;
  unique legacy names upgrade, ambiguous/missing identities require reselection.
  Reopening clears the prior gear latch. Shifter setup waits for pause.
- Cancel unfinished direct-input assignment when driving resumes. Flip, Clear
  and assignment saves use idle persistence and retain failed-write retries.

- Direct axis/button assignments now retain the device's instance GUID across
  USB enumeration changes. Unique legacy bindings upgrade after a successful
  read; ambiguous identical-device bindings ask for reassignment instead of
  silently selecting another controller. Missing devices supply neutral input.
- Retry missing/failed direct-input readers while idle at a bounded rate. Assign
  refreshes devices to discover a newly plugged handbrake; reader discovery and
  assignment wait for pause rather than interrupting active driving.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- Opt-in frame-hitch counts, loaded-mod versions and latest direct-input values
  in support files. Logging help explains how to collect a short reproduction.

- Rebind all 11 camera tuning keys in the settings panel, with clear, cancel,
  duplicate-key feedback and restore-defaults. Existing XML/numpad mappings are
  preserved. Bumper-only setups can configure keys; editing the panel suppresses
  camera hotkeys until held input is released.

### Fixed

- Read existing game state without invoking the game's lazy manager factory.
  Menu polling could repeatedly construct failing managers and queue ghost
  downloads that continued during driving. The RC4 log exposed this defect;
  regression checks pass and the owner's RC5 retest has no initialization,
  connection or exception flood. Other users' intermittent slowdowns remain open.

- Avoid competing with Nexus CameraMod for camera slots: when it is loaded, its
  chase views keep control and our mounted views/tuning are suspended with an
  explanation in the panel. Saved mount settings are preserved.
- Correct telemetry suspension meters/normalized compression and vehicle-local
  motion axes. Reset acceleration history across pause, restart, spawn, invalid
  samples and teleports. Changed motion/shaker response needs attended validation.
- Observe toolkit telemetry send failures returned as false, so a dead socket
  stops retrying every physics step; correcting/restarting the endpoint recovers.
- Bound support-log reads and retain recent native errors; collect while paused.
  Force commands are reported without claiming measured torque or prescribing gain.
- Clarify the legacy steering-limiter checkbox's spawn-only behavior; it does
  not temporarily set and restore the game's numeric assist slider.

- Clear cached direct-input values when readers close or bindings reload, so
  a failed reopen cannot retain a held pedal. Flip now swaps pedal endpoints and
  flipped steering calibration survives restart. Failed assignment reads wait
  for a valid resting sample before detecting movement. The direct-input panel
  shows live normalized values for setup checks.

- Camera tuning retains failed saves and retries while idle, including after
  leaving the mounted view or disabling the mod. Save success is logged only
  after a successful write; held adjustments no longer log every frame.

### Documentation

- Record the 0.2.3 publication and verified local installation, GitHub audit,
  T300/TSS feedback and prioritized overnight queue. Add direct handbrake setup
  and a camera-key XML example.
- Audit T300 rotation, proportional handbrake input and available road/landing
  signals. Add a synthetic managed effects lab; retain the production force tune.
  Track separate telemetry sampling corrections as KI-16.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-09-08

Owner RC6 testing found no stutter, working cameras and no control issues so far.
Automated checks cover the fixes below. The complete attended matrix and
hardware-specific reports remain open; see [release notes](docs/releases/0.2.3.md).

### Fixed

- Restore the mounted camera's child transform and FOV on handback, including
  replay/cinematic transitions where the game disables CarCameras; stop camera
  control when the mod/view is disabled. Owner camera smoke test passed. Issue #1's
  reporter separately resolved their symptom by unplugging a PS5 controller.
- Defer learned-axis settings writes until driving stops. Retain pending changes
  after a failed save, throttle retries and release FFB/telemetry before shutdown
  persistence. Use compatible XML with atomic replacement so failed saves keep
  the previous settings intact. The reported stage-start stutter is not yet confirmed fixed.
- Keep vendored toolkit artifacts tracked so a clone can build with local game/UMM
  references. Validate candidate payloads before install and preserve settings and
  user files during uninstall.
- Recover telemetry after correcting a failed destination or explicitly restarting
  it. Suppress repeated connection attempts for an unchanged failing endpoint,
  and dispose the failed socket. Verified with production code and loopback UDP.

### Added

- Consistent numeric mod versions, embedded RC/revision/source identity, package
  manifests and SHA-256 receipts. Support files observe resident native modules
  and report their actual file paths, hashes and component versions.
- Development-only capture probe and external control scripts, standalone replay
  without game dependencies, and immutable regression cases. These tools are not
  shipped; packaging rejects recorder code or dependencies in the release mod.
- Automated consumer regressions, installer smoke tests and a separate attended
  release gate. See [PRE-RELEASE-TESTING.md](docs/PRE-RELEASE-TESTING.md).
- A force reference vector shared with the toolkit, plus dynamic regression
  coverage against the original formula and stateful before/after capture replay.

### Changed

- Adopt toolkit 0.12's managed wrapper and `AxleForceCurve@1`, preserving the
  existing gain/fade/clamp/smoothing pipeline. Package Dbce.Wheel.Ffb.dll. New wheel
  selections save strict GUIDs; legacy settings remain readable.
- Transactional sync, shared reader identity across FFB switching, panic recovery
  and complete input shutdown. Disabling FFB releases output immediately; enabling
  it after a disabled launch initializes the wheel.
- Corrected native installation guidance, issue certainty and the roadmap.
  Detailed engineering review: [2026-09-06-rc-review.md](docs/reviews/2026-09-06-rc-review.md).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- **Native plugin and telemetry encoder now come from dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit
  0.1.0**, vendored under `lib/toolkit` and pinned by `lib/toolkit/VERSION`.
  `UnityForceFeedback.dll` is the toolkit's `WheelFfb.dll` under the name the
  mod P/Invokes (same exports plus the toolkit's lifecycle additions);
  `ArtOfSimRally.Telemetry.dll` is replaced by `Dbce.Wheel.Telemetry.dll`, a
  byte-identical encoder whose test suite moved with it. The local copies of
  both, the telemetry tests, the probe and the synth tool are removed from this
  repo (`tools/forza` in the toolkit replaces the last two). No behaviour change
  intended.
- **Default force feedback is 30% lighter** (`FyReference` 8,000 → 11,500 N).
  At Strength 50 the 0.2.1 default was still too strong on a MOZA R12; the
  slider midpoint now sits where that rig wanted it.

### Added

- **Direct wheel input** (new "Wheel input (direct)" section). For wheels the
  game's controls screen never responds to — a Fanatec base shows up as two
  identical `FANATEC Wheel` entries the game's input library cannot read.
  Steering, throttle, brake, clutch and handbrake are read straight from the
  device and fed to the car, bypassing that library; assign each by "Assign,
  then move it", and the range calibrates itself the first time the control
  is used fully. Any DirectInput controller can supply any channel, so
  separate pedals work too. Menus still use the keyboard or a pad.
  Switching the game's input library to DirectInput instead was tried twice
  and left the menus dead both times; it remains only as a Settings.xml
  experiment, not in the panel.
- Support bundle now records which input backend was active.
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, with a Fanatec section first.
- Device dropdowns show axis and button counts, so two devices with the same
  name (a Fanatec base's two `FANATEC Wheel` entries) can be told apart.

### Fixed

- **Direct wheel input steered inverted** when the wheel had been turned left
  during Assign: the moved direction became +1, and the game reads +1 as
  right. Steering assignment now always takes the increasing side of the
  axis as right (DirectInput's convention on every wheel), and each bound
  channel has a Flip button.
- **Crash when choosing a shifter** whenever force feedback had failed to
  initialise (reported with a Fanatec bundle). Listing controllers created a
  temporary DirectInput instance and released it, leaving the device table
  filled; opening the chosen device then used the released instance. One
  instance now lives for the whole session.
- **Force feedback gave up when the preferred device had no actuator.** A
  Fanatec base presents two `FANATEC Wheel` devices and only one does force
  feedback; picking the other failed with `0x80040154` and left the wheel
  dead. The other candidates are now tried before giving up.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **Bumper camera.** A second mounted view after the bonnet view in the
  rotation — lower and further forward, just above the front bumper. Its own
  height, forward, side, pitch and field of view; the numpad adjusts whichever
  of the two views is on screen and resets that one alone. Can be switched off
  separately from the bonnet view.

### Changed

- **Force feedback is now lateral force through a pneumatic trail, not the
  game's aligning torque.** `Mz` is a Pacejka curve that reverses sign at
  about 8° of slip, and this game's front tyres sit at 12–29° in ordinary
  corners — so the wheel flipped from centring to pulling toward lock in the
  middle of every corner ("there is no centre"). The new force is the front
  axle's `Fy` scaled by a trail that shrinks toward the limit: it centres in
  proportion to load, lightens as the front starts to slide, never reverses.
  Fades out below 12 km/h, where slip angles mean nothing. Sign confirmed on
  a MOZA R12; `Invert` remains for wheels that read the axis the other way.
  `MzReference` is replaced by `FyReference` (8,000 N).

### Fixed

- **Telemetry parked until the lights went green.** `IsRaceOn` used the strict
  "driving" state, which is false during the countdown, so SimHub treated the
  start line as race-off and a bass shaker ignored the engine while revving.
  It is now true from the start-line hold onward; forces still wait for green.
- **Force feedback inverted on one side only** (MOZA R5, reported with a
  log). The native plugin passed the sign in both the direction vector and the
  magnitude; a negative magnitude reverses the direction again, so on a wheel
  that honours both the force always pointed the same way — right turns
  correct, left inverted, and *Invert* could not help because it negates both.
  The **signed magnitude alone** now carries which way to pull, with the
  direction vector's length matching it: right for a wheel that honours
  direction (R5), for one that ignores it and reads the magnitude sign (R12),
  and for single-axis wheels (Fanatec), which already worked that way.
- **Force feedback stopping mid-session and never returning.** Alt-tabbing
  away from the game left the wheel acquired non-exclusively
  (`DIERR_NOTEXCLUSIVEACQUIRED`), which force feedback cannot use, and nothing
  re-acquired it. Now re-acquired and retried automatically; the exclusive
  mode is also bound to the game's own window rather than whatever was in
  front at startup.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-01

The shifter release. Also the point at which the settings panel stopped being
a wall of switches.

### Added

- **Separate shifter support, H-pattern and sequential.** Bind a real shifter
  on its own device. The game only has ShiftUp and ShiftDown actions, so even a
  bound H-pattern lever would have behaved like paddles — selecting 3rd would
  have meant "one gear up from wherever you are". This reads the shifter
  directly and selects the gear you actually chose. Both modes verified on
  hardware.
- **Gear binding inside the settings panel.** Click "set", move the lever, done.
  The rows match your shifter type rather than showing seven gates for a
  sequential.
- **Wheel and shifter dropdowns.** Pick a device by name instead of typing one.
- **"Create support file on Desktop".** Collects settings, controllers, what is
  actually bound, and the logs into one file to attach to a bug report.
- **Install.bat and Uninstall.bat.** Double-click to install. Finds the game on
  non-default Steam libraries, checks Unity Mod Manager is present, and refuses
  to run while the game is open. Uninstall keeps your settings.
- **Button names where the game has no icon.** Unrecognised wheels render some
  bindings as an empty box; they now read `B12` instead of nothing.
- **"Bind whichever device you touch"**, since the controls screen otherwise
  only binds the first joystick it finds.
- **"Skip neutral"** for sequential shifters — reverse to first in one press.
- **Live input status and a rescan button**, showing what the game's input layer
  can actually see.

### Changed

- **The settings panel is drawn by hand**, in collapsible sections with headings
  that do not look like dropdowns, and help text that no longer runs off the
  edge of the panel.
- **Strength is a 0-100 slider.** It was previously a reference-torque figure
  where lower meant stronger, which nobody should have to reason about.
- **Changing the wheel applies immediately.** Trying each of two similarly named
  devices to see which one moves is the natural way to pick one, and that needs
  the change to take effect now rather than next launch.
- **Telemetry host and port apply immediately** for the same reason — working
  out which port is free is exactly when you change it repeatedly.
- **The native plugin loads from the mod folder**, and the loaded path is
  logged. Resolving it loosely had silently loaded a stale copy.

### Fixed

- **Shifter failing to open at load.** Enumeration was skipped whenever force
  feedback had already initialised DirectInput, so the first open always failed.
- **H-pattern holding the car in neutral.** With nothing bound yet, every frame
  read as "no gate held", which is neutral — indistinguishable from the mod
  having broken the game.
- **The end-of-stage camera swing**, partially. The stock rig damps toward its
  target from wherever the camera is, so letting go while mounted inside the car
  sent it out through the bodywork. It now hands back in one step. Some
  movement remains; see Known issues.
- **Help text cut off at the left edge** of the settings panel.
- **Force feedback stopping during cutscenes** rather than fighting the AI.

### Known issues

- The camera can still swing about briefly when the game takes control at the
  end of a stage. Cosmetic, confined to the results cinematic.
- Developed against a MOZA R12 Base. The steering and deadzone fixes should
  apply to any wheel Rewired does not recognise — reasoning, not testing.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-01

Tagged at the same commit as 0.1.1 by mistake, so the support-file button its
release notes announced did not actually ship until 0.2.0.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- **Force feedback on wheels with a single force-feedback axis**, which covers
  Fanatec bases. The effect was created with a two-axis fallback to one, but
  every update still sent two axes, so each one failed silently and the wheel
  stayed dead. Reported by the first user to try it.
- Failures during force-feedback updates are now logged instead of discarded.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-01

First release. Turns art of rally into something you can drive on a wheel.

### Added

- **Force feedback.** The game ships the calling code and the physics for it but
  never joined them, and the DLL it looks for is not in the build at all. This
  supplies that DLL and closes the gap.
- **Direct steering**, removing the gamepad smoothing the game applies to wheels
  it does not recognise.
- **Removal of a hidden 10% deadzone** applied by the game's input library,
  separate from the one in the options screen and shown nowhere.
- **Bonnet camera**, added to the game's own view rotation, with live numpad
  tuning.
- **Forza-compatible UDP telemetry**, for SimHub, dashboards, bass shakers and
  motion rigs.
